"1" 1 "This little stick-of-gum sized piece of hardware blows my mind. I did a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro onto it in mere minutes, and the system boots in a few seconds.If you're not in the know here's a NOTE:Make sure your system is utilizing the new UEFI platform rather than the old BIOS platform to take full advantage of the latest tricknology and all of its advantages. This means your system drive (where you install Windows) will have a \"GPT\" Volume rather than a \"MBR\" Volume. You'll have to boot into your UEFI interface, and turn off \"CSM\" likely under BOOT Options before installing Windows or directly afterwards as well as when you update your UEFI/BIOS. It's good to double-check the CSM setting stays off whenever you add another storage drive as well.If you type \"Disk Management\" in Windows start menu search box, double click to open screen, right click on your system drive, select \"Properties\", and choose \"Volumes\" tab, you'll see either \"GPT\" or 'MBR\" listed under \"Partition Style\".One last thing: Consider backing up your important stuff, and just fresh install your OP System making sure to use the UEFI/GPT platform; I've never had success converting an MBR System from the dark side over to the light side of the force unfortunately. But, I'm just a novice with little experience.5 year warranty, and as fast as you need. Samsung is hard to beat. " "July 30, 2018" "5.0"
"2" 2 "This is the best and fastest drive I have ever had by far. Replaced my 250gb 960 evo with this new 512gb 970 Pro in literally minutes! Using Samsung¡¯s excellent cloning software, I cloned the 960 to an old 840 Pro, replaced the 960 with the 970 and rebooted with the 840, then cloned the 840 to the 970. Literally took maybe 10 minutes total! Technology sure has come a long way from the old days. I¡¯m actually seeing double the write performance for the 970 Pro over the 960 evo.

"3" 3 "The Samsung 970 Pro 1TB NVMe SSD is the best SSD on the market today. With the revised Samsung pricing been 130 dollars less than the original MSRP this SSD is now a very very good value. When you look at the performance and advantages of the 970 Pro over the 970 EVO and other SSDs on the market it becomes very clear this SSD is the best. First of all, the type of NAND the 970 Pro uses is different than almost any other SSD on the market. While almost every SSD on the market is made of 3-bit 3D NAND, the 970 Pro uses the much better 2-bit MLC V-NAND. This NAND has several advantages over 3-bit 3D NAND, much better performance, much better endurance, more reliable and the most important one, doesn't slow down like 3-bit 3D NAND does. Samsung has 5 years warranty on this drive, has the best support in the business and when you look at the overall picture, the Samsung 970 Pro is well worth the extra money over the 970 EVO in my opinion. The experience by using this SSD is awesome. Your PC feels so fast and responsive. I highly recommend that if you can spend the extra 100 for the 970 Pro just do it. The advantages are very clear. This is a wonderful wonderful SSD. 10/10. " "July 12, 2018" "5.0"

I settled on the TEKQ Rapide Thunderbolt 3 SSD and decided I want it maxed out in terms of performance so I took the plunge on this Samsung 970 PRO 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 to replace the TEKQ's internal SSD.Well, I'm truly blown away by the performance of this SSD. Samsung is definitely on the cutting edge with SSD. This thing smokes. I'm not a video/photo pro myself but do handle large media files for the company's marketing work which involves editing and shuttling of studio photos of products and demo videos. I also oversee operations so I don't want such work to slow me down in anyway.I can happily say that the TEKQ Rapide Thunderbolt 3 with this Samsung 970 PRO SSD is, by far, the best external SSD I've ever had the pleasure of using. I suppose it'll only get faster and better in the future but, for what I do, this is about as good as it gets. It feels and works as fast as my iMac 27\" 5K and MBP's internal SSDs. An HD movie file transfers in a split second.I'm not a geek so I don't care to measure the speed using an app like Blackmagic. I can easily sense it while doing real life work and it makes me more productive. I have the HP P800 as well in the work office and it's great but the TEKQ with this Samsung SSD is a step above, even if we're talking a fragment of a second. Awesome stuff.

"8" 8 "these are great, i have used samsung ssds for a long time now and they have always outperformed the competition, and sometimes even their own advertised specs. i would recommend samsung memory over others for the ground up approach they take to design, using ics and firmware built in house, to keep reliability high. anyways, i think these are not as good as the sata samsung ssds i have had usually are. i bought two of them, used them in multiple configurations (different ports on the board, different levels of raid), and found them to be a modest increase in speed, but not the 4x speed that i see cited in places online. certain actions are very fast, like using dd on an entire 512gb drive, which took seconds. things like boot time, however, seem mostly unchanged. my biggest issue was the adhesive stickers, it seemed to be only their for marketing and makes it so i cant attach a heatsink without breaking out the heat gun and trying to clean all the gunk off. i understand that samsung claims its drives are built for running without a heatsink, but i would really appreciate the option, some of us want our pcs as silent and cool as possible. also my VMs do not see the same speeds my native linux host does, and this is after a lot of messing around with hugepages, raid, and the IO emulator. a sequential read write test will give numbers in the 3000mbps but when i try a more real world test they seems to slow down. i am still playing with settings of course, and might well edit this later.

I was trying to clone 960 EVO 0.5TB in my HP Elitebook 820 G3 to 970 PRO 1TB and here are the major issues:1. Samsung Data Migration requires destination drive to be Samsung.2. I found one USB 3.1 external enclosure for M keyed NVME drives and it does not pass drive ID to the system so the 970 PRO was not detected by Data Migration soft as a valid destination drive.3. I could not boot Win 7 using my 960 EVO in that external enclosure (Windows kept crashing almost immediately). I tried that to keep 970 PRO installed inside the laptop hoping Data Migration will detect it as destination drive.4. I also tried using NGFF M.2 Key A+E to Key M SSD Adapter to connect the drive via internal NGFF M.2 connector used for WiFi card but the system did not see the drive at all.5. I tried using two Asus Hyper M.2 x4 cards in my desktop HTPC to connect these two drives. While they both were detected by the system, Samsung Data Migration software requires system drive (the one you boot from) to be source drive, so I still couldn't clone them.Eventually, I installed 960 EVO back inside the laptop, 970 PRO in the external USB enclosure and cloned everything with AOMEI Backupper (Clone Disk option). After installing 970 PRO inside the laptop I just extended system partition with Windows tools. One more thing to remember: install Samsung NVME driver before you clone your system.

This drive either needs a firmware fix, or the one I have is defective.Sadly, I've probably waited too long to do anything about it.

Cloned the existing 128GB drive to a Samsung EVO 850 then installed the 970 PRO driver (again, from Samsung). Finally cloned the EVO 850 back to the 970 PRO. Worked perfectly - the laptop immediately booted with no issues. Finally installed Samsung Magician which manages the health of the SSD and gives you plenty of warning when the drive is beginning to wear out (600TBW on the 512GB drive, 1200 on the 1GB drive).The 970 PRO is one of the last to offer MLC technology which equates to superior wear over TLC. There was a huge difference in boot-up times over the stock 128GB M.2 drive that came with the laptop (almost 50% faster) so make no mistake, this is a fast drive.

"14" 14 "Picked up an new M2 SSD Hard Drive. I have 2 drives in my Dell 7710 laptop right now. The boot drive is a 256GB Samsung SM951 M2 drive. Older tech for M2 drives. I have a 2.5\" spinner 1TB Samsung Spinpoint M8 drive. I put this one into my computer to back up the boot drive.The M2 drive is getting full, I have less than 10% left before it's full so I decided to get another M2 drive. I've been eying the Samsung Pro 960 for a while now and it was about $325 for a 512GB. A bit on the expensive side. After waiting for some time a Pro 970 came out which was less expensive and faster. So I decided I'd do that one. I still waited, probably 4 months. The price kept coming down, going up and then down again. Finally it reached $170 and I got it.It showed up today and all I needed was an M2x2.5mm screw. Got one at the hardware store, it was 12mm long so I just cut it.Installed it in the laptop as my 3rd drive. Rebooted the computer, took a while for the Dell logo to come up. Figured it was configuring it. I expected a new hardware message, drivers loading etc. But it booted straight into Windows. I checked the files and no new drive. No joy for me.So I went into the Intel Rapid Storage Technology program which shows me what's going on with my drives. It didn't show up in there. Less joy.So I rebooted and went into the BIOS and it was listed there. Nothing to save because I didn't change anything. Rebooted. I checked for the drive and nothing. Went to the Rapid Storage program and it showed there. But all I can do there is RAID stuff, join drives, make arrays and such, but that's not what I wanted to do.So I went into disk management and it sees the drive also. I gave it a volume, assigned a letter and did a quick format. Now there was joy. I had my new drive.Before I did anything I checked out the speed with Crystal Disk Mark 5.And the new 970 M2 drive is 1.72x as fast as my old SM 951. I CDM5 my 1TB spinner just for fun and the results are just laughable.After that was time to clone the drive and swap the new drive to C: as the boot.I used Macrium Reflect to clone the drive. Took 25 minutes 22 seconds to clone the 256GB drive to the new 512GB drive. Rebooted into the BIOS and swapped the old drive to the new for the boot drive. Easy as placing a check mark in a box.Rebooted and it fired right up. I went to the disk management program to confirm that the new drive was the boot drive and it was.Mission accomplished.

However, I don't expect it to last a decade - if I'm lucky it's probably going to go bad after 3-4 years. So value for money is definitely not what it could be.It's easy to install. if you can install a standard SATA drive, you can install this. If your motherboard supports it, it's a very small single screw, gentle insert the card, and use the screw to \"lock\" in place (do not tighten it!). That's it. No wires to manage. Shows up as an ordinary drive. For Linux users, it will not be using the scsi simulator and hence not show up as /dev/sd* - but beside that, it's just like any other drive.

"22" 22 "M.2 2280 SSD is the latest standard for fast storage on a PC platform. Looks like a stick of RAM but behaves like a solid state drive (SSD). Installed in my mainboard in about 3 minutes. It's actually easier to install than an old-fashioned SATA drive or SATA SSD. Windows 10 recognized it as a bootable device, and installed seamlessly. The real advantage here is the blinding speed. M.2 standard allows this \"drive\" to communicate with the memory bus far faster than older standards. Loading time for Windows at startup is a small fraction of what it would be on a standard SSD connected using a SATA cable. The only drawback is that M.2 drives are still pretty small by comparison to rotating platter SATA drives. So power users of M.2 technology will probably want to have a SATA drive or two in addition to the M.2 drive.

"24" 24 "I was going to wait for the 970 EVO 1TB to become available at MSRP but when I saw this one at its intended price I jumped on it. I was getting discouraged because after the launch of the Samsung 970 series, the 1 TB models seemed to be in short supply and if it was available, third party sellers were selling it well above MSRP. I previously had a 950 Pro 512GB drive that I purchased a couple a years ago and has served me well. Because of that, the transition to the 970 was very easy using the Samsung migration software. I had almost purchased a WD Black 1TB NVME drive at an unbelievable price but the seller ended up cancelling the sale. Regardless, I think I will be happier with this drive and it will be my OS drive for a very long time.This drive isn't for everyone. I wanted the best there is so I decided to purchase but to be honest I don't notice much of a difference from the 950 Pro in real world operations and for that matter its not much different of an experience from the Samsung SATA SSD 860 that I recently purchased. If you are into benchmarks, you will notice the difference right away.Before purchasing this I considered purchasing the HP EX920 1TB, the WD Black 1TB NVME, and the 970 EVO 1TB. If I had seen the 960 Pro 1TB at a deep discount, I may have ended up purchasing that.

I never full grasp how slow my older SSD was until I installed this joint.First off you'll need to get an adapter and this is the one that helped: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CWWAENG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Of the multitude of examples I looked for make the process seamless, honest the way i did it was fool proof and straight a ahead. First off, make sure you get a decent clone app (i.e. carbon clone) and a spare ssd that can handle the space you'll need to do the swap to the newer SSD. MAKE THE CLONE YOUR NEW BOOT DESTINATION. It's infinately easier than getting another usb, putting High Sierra on it, and dealing with the speed - CAUSE IT'S SLOW. Once I made the clone ssd the boot drive there was no lag - it was if the clone was the installed drive. Secondly, once you install this SSD into the MBP next (a priority for anyone who knows) format the newer SSD. Once that's done, you'll need to restart the computer and go through the process of \"restoring\" the drive by holding option during the restart process. Use your clone SSD as the source to restore your SSD and use the migrate data function. Next, wait. It took about an hour or so for the migration to take place. More than likely, it's due to how much your moving over.I never had the issue of my computer with going to sleep and I occasionally have the issue when I restart the computer, where it take a while or doesn't fully restart but so far so good.

"32" 32 "This NVMe M.2 Samsung 970 PRO is one of the best investments for a person who is in need or wanting very fast storage at a fairly affordable prive point. While using this 2280 mm SSD in the optimal slot on my motherboard, I can open and start editing video using Adobe Premiere Pro in a literal second or less. For anyone this would be an instant boost in your performance and productivity in terms of work flow. With the main installation of this product being to undo 1 screw minimum to 4 screws in my case (pc joke haha) the installation process is a sinch as you only need to attach the SSD to your motherboard and install the operating software for this storage go into your motherboard bios and identify that its a drive, then if not already partitioned using your windows or mac operating system just use the partitioning software and then drag and drop files in and on the drive (sounds like a lot of work but really only took me roughly 20 min. to complete with actually physical installation of the SSD). So in my use case and many others this would and is a great way to upgrade your storage of any system outfitted with an open m.2 slot. " "January 6, 2019" "4.0"
"33" 33 "So I got this because I have purchased a SATA samsung drive in the past, and it was a great upgrade to my PC. Everything just worked the user experience was amazing. So I decided to go for this drive. Now before I start the rant and list pro's and cons I want to point it out that I am treating this as a \"PREMIUM\" product, due to the price tag and everything else.1) Software: Im not sure if this is because they still have not figured it out or what, but how can a samsung software (samsung magician and samsung data migration) not be able to tell that the drive is SAMSUNG, even when it read the vendor ID correctly and the label from the drop down menu says samsung is beyond me. Wasted a lot of time on this. Finally got the cloning tool to work, only to see that it only cloned 2 of my 5 partitions. That's a no go, used another tool to clone my stuff, but again, premium product with vendor supplied software should work. If I wanted a product that doesn't need/get's firmware updates etc. and needs 3rd party software to get it up and running I would have gone for one of the $100 drives and saved the money, potentially gotten more storage too. Samsung drives need consistent firmware updates to maintain their performance that you paid a premium for and to patch bugs. If this is not an option, then there is no point in paying for that premium. On an NVMe drive you wont notice, as a normal user, the minor differences in read/write, what you pay for is ease of usability and reliability.2) Customer support: advertised as 24/7 (I dont really expect that so it's OK that it wasn't). Called them in, got bounced around a bunch until they told they can't help me.Pros: if you dont care about maintaining proper firmware on the drive or using samsung tools, and are content with this as a bare drive then it's a pretty decent drive for a year or two.3) Drivers: Due to the above two points I was unable to install the samsung NVMe driver, and had to resort to a generic microsoft driver, which does not give you an optimal drive performance, at which point there is no point in using this drive...Cons: If you are planning to use any of the samsung tools may want to go for one of the older models, hopefully those are supported better.Overall the HW performance was pretty decent, but the user experience was absolutely terrible. Maybe they are still working out the NVMe part of it? I dont know.Bottom line: It's a drive, it's still decent hardware, it's quite expensive for what it is. If the above points were fixed would have been a great product. Returned as unusable in my situation. " "May 18, 2019" "2.0"

The speed is really amazing, although I wish the one terabyte NVMe was cheaper, as I find myself keeping most of my games and such on my hard drive to save space, missing potentially huge improvements in loading times. One wonderful issue that has been resolved as a result of using this NVMe drive is USB 3.0 transfer speeds. Now I can finally transfer files at USB 3.0 speeds, without frequent and sudden drops or general low speed. I've noticed that even transferring files from my hard drive to a USB is faster now, which I can only assume is due to the fact that my Windows system isn't taking up any hard drive bandwidth by running on the hard drive as I read from it.

The CPU arrived but the chip was loose inside the box. I could not install Windows 10 but was able to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. When I ran Chrome or Firefox under , the CPU kept hanging up. I changed to Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 DRAM 2133MHz (PC4 17000) C13 Memory Kit - Black, thinking may be memmory compabibil;ity from what I read on Youtube, web. But the problem still occured, can not install windows, kept on hanging when runing Chrome, FireFox under Ubuntu. Changed to G.SKILL Flare X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) AMD X370 Memory Model F4-3200C14D-16GFX. Same problem occrued. I changed the mem clock to from 1600-3200 for 3200 MHZ and 1600-2133 MHZ for 2133 MHZ and 1600-3200 for G.Skill. Same problem. Can not install Windows 10. hung when ran Chrome under Ubuntu. Hung when ran Geekbench when it run under multi core, single core is ok. I ran mem test and it was ok. Thinking the CPU was damage during ship, I ask for replacement and got one. When i installed in the system ansd ran with G.Skill, It was able to boot windows 10, Ubuntu and no problem.I had to upgrade the BIOS to 1402 for the Asus Zenith to boot with 2950x.Now it works very smoothly.

"325" 325 "I just got the new 970 PRO, 512 GB and cloned data from my SATA M.2 to this 970 PRO NVMe one using the Samsung Data Migration tool. To begin with when i tested with Samsung Magician and just got 3200-3300 MB/s not 3500 MB/s.And, i just did the clone of around 180GB of data from my old M.2 to this NVMe M.2, now Samsung Magician SMART shows I've used 1.4 TB of TBW. Really !!! I don't understand why it took 6.6 times of data written in Total Bytes Written. Is this normal, or something wrong in 970 PRO, as I've never seen TBW increasing so many times just after initial clone of hardly 200GB of data.Question i've is, why should a latest and greatest NVMe SSD takes 1.4TB for cloning a 180GB SSD in first place done thru Samsung's own Disk Migration tool in a brand New drive ?Second regarding upto MB/s, 960 EVOs I think gives 3000-3200 MB/s, for $159, why for just 100 more MB/s Samsung charges a premium of $90 calling it as PRO ? Is it a Lime or my unit is bad is my concern.Update: I just returned the 1st one and got a 2nd now, this one gives around 3500+ MB/s Read & 2300 MB/s Write, slightly better than 1st one and 960, still marginal difference though.BTW, cloning calc seems to shows x1.5 times of data cloned, not sure why.

I submitted two pics, one with the 3543 read was the 970pro and the one with the 2792 read was the 850pro. As you can see in the tests the 4k q1T1 size craps out in read tests. Why Samsung why?Games and things load quick but its not all its cracked to be until they get the 4k files on par. I honestly expected a lot lot more. I am super impressed with the 850pro but not with the 970pro. I mean it works flawlessly but it takes longer to boot. Both drives were on the same machine with the same setup and new installs of win10 fall creators edition. 970 is 512gb and 850 is 256gb. Hope this helps people. " "August 14, 2018" "5.0"

"465" 465 "I bought a CyberPowerPC with an MSI B360M Bazooka motherboard. I have 2 gripes about this NEW SSD1. Samsung's Data Migration Software doesn't work for this MB. (updated all firmware and software drivers) I spent a good 8 hours trying to clone the drive. I've tried all Data Migration software. Only EaseUS Todo 11.0 worked on it's first pass. Spent hours trying to clone, but got lucky by using EaseUS.2. Ran Samsung Magician after successful install and clone. Ran 2 tests and got ~3500 Read, but ~2303 Write. Couldn't get 2700. Maybe it's my MSI MB bios. 3rd test created a BSOD DPC Watchdog Violation while running the test to 85%. I guess the test stressed the SSD too much.It runs great now, but Advertised Ease of cloning was false, write speeds were also not 2700 and BSOD from Samsung Magician is annoying (don't run tests on your SSD). Sorry, couldn't take pic of Cloning Failure!I think the BSOD was created on purpose by Samsung, so we can't test the drives! That's just my conspiracy theory. :p " "June 23, 2018" "2.0"
"466" 466 "Title: Writes as Fast as It Reads!Current system is as followsGigabyte z370 Aourus Mainboard16 gigabytes DDR4 RAMSamsung 950 pro SSD Boot Drive2 TB Mechanical storage DriveNvidia Gtx1070Intel 240 Gig ssd for Music productionIntel core i5 8th Gen 8670K unlocked and running at 4.2 ghzPackaging:Very well packaged and well protected in a harder shell plastic shellInstallation:Easy install. NVMe slots means the drive can only be insertedone way with a single screw to hold the drive in place.Cloning from previous drive:Installing the Samsung data migration software downloaded from their website went smoothly. Then came rebooting and launching the software. It selected the current boot disk as source, selected the 970 pro as destination. Then it was just click OK to begin the cloning process. Cloning drives to SSD's usually takes anywhere from 15 minutes to a 2 hours depending on the amount of data to be copied and the speed of the source disk. Also there is typically a little bit of testing to be done afterwards because (especially with Quickbooks) something doesn't copy correctly and a reinstallation is needed to get things working again.Not this time. The write speed of the new drive was impressive.Typical SSD's have a very fast read speed and a not so fast write speed. So cloning can take a while as the write speed is significantly slower than read. Cloning from a Samsung 950 pro SSD, the read speed out of the 950 would normally be buffered down to the write speed of the new 970. This was not the case. The drive with 266 gigabytes of data was cloned in just under 10 minutes. The Write speed of the new 970 is just as fast as the read speed of the 950.The transfer rate of 311 MB/s is ridiculously fast. Imagine installing photoshop in 3 seconds. If it was just a raw datatransfer, that would be possible. Basically a transfer of a gigabyte of data in just under 4 seconds.Once cloning was completed, booted into system BIOS and changed the boot drive to the new 970 and reset.Initial boot took about 12 seconds, still really fast but not as fast as the 950 just replaced. Once windows fully booted it discovered the drive and installed the appropriate NVMe driver and asked for a reboot.The next boot was significantly faster, up and running and into the desktop in about 4 seconds.Testing:Quickbooks has never worked after cloning a drive without some sort of ¡°not installed properly¡± error. The only way to resolve it was to uninstall it, then delete the Intuit folder out of the hidden AppData folder at the root of C:, and reinstall. Unprecedentedly, it installed with no error!This must be due to the Samsung cloning software doing something different than anyone else. ( usually EZ GIG IV)Everything else just plain worked. Typical launch times increased quite a bit, Word 1 second, Excel 1 second, Quickbooks 3 seconds, browser windows almost instantly, Photoshop and Lightroom 5 seconds. So nice.SSD's have been great for many years and Samsung has always made the best. This one is no exception. It is extremely fast, very reliable, and combined with the Samsung migration software is a winning combo.Absolutely recommended!!(thanks to a very smart nephew-in-law) " "June 27, 2018" "5.0"
"467" 467 "The 970 Pro SSD may be a top of the line SSD now, but the installation has been far from plug and play. I have a brand new Dell Inspiron laptop that is compatible with the SSD. My computer didn't automatically recognize it and I cannot install the drivers for this SSD. Benchmark speed are 1/2 of what the product boasts per Samsung Magician. What they don't tell you is that you have to go through and switch the hard drives from RAID to AHCI. That switch will make you reinstall Windows. I don't really have time for all of this.

"468" 468 "I purchased Samsung 970 Pro 512 GB MLC V-NAND NVMe SSD at local store and installed it on MIS GE73 8RF.I installed Windows 10 on 970 Pro and it was very fast and even impressive. The speed of pre-installed Kingston NVMe 256 GB SSD was 1589 in sequential read and 913 in sequential write, while Samsung 970 Pro read 3495 and wrote 2352.Because I'd installed same Windows 10 Pro on Kingston NVMe SSD a few days ago, I could easily appreciate the speed of 970 Pro was way faster. I also have a Plextor M8PeG 512 GB NVMe SSD installed on GE73 8RF and it reads about 2500 and writes about 1200.As long as the price is not in concern, 970 Pro is definitely the faster of the three.Amazon deleted my review a few days ago and I'm posting my review more briefly now.

"469" 469 "In real-world performance, I've yet to see significant difference in the speed of current-generation NVMe drives. The benchmarks may be slightly different, but even working with the massive files I use on a regular basis, and taking time off from work to play very demanding games, all of the NVMe drives are lightning fast. Comparing performance results feels like splitting hairs.With that said, whenever possible, I still splurge for the Samsung drives for one reason - reliability. I've only had one fail, ever (and I still think that was the OS's fault), and Samsung provided an immediate replacement. Based on what I have seen of other users' experiences, the quality control and reliability of Samsung SSD's is the best on the market, and my experience bears that out.With this particular drive, I would caution you to make absolutely certain that your motherboard is compatible with it, both in terms of architecture and capacity. m.2 drives are still fairly new, and early generations of motherboard can have issues. In my experience, if the motherboard specifies NVMe compatibility, my experience is that an NVMe drive will work. If it's an older m.2 slot, your mileage may vary.In both the EVO of Pro models, performance of the 970 is a noticeable jump over the 960. As for the decision between the EVO and Pro models - that's a tough one. On paper, write speeds and thermal performance should be slightly better on the Pro, but the warranties are the same (five years). With the exception of users working with the most demanding applications (e.g. video editing of huge files), I think most people will be fine with the EVO. " "June 19, 2018" "5.0"

"472" 472 "NVMe drives like this are the way mainstream storage is headed. It is nice to just pop a tiny drive onto your motherboard and not need power or data cables to make it work. If you pick up a good drive like this from a company that backs their product it is hard to go wrong. All of these drives are fast enough that unless you have a specialized use case and you know you¡¯ll benefit from a particular drive you generally won¡¯t notice any difference in the during the course of normal use. I ran this drive in my Ryzen system and compared it to other NVMe drives. The drives I used for comparison were the 1TB and 512GB Western Digital Black, 1TB Samsung 960 Evo, 1TB Samsung 970 Evo, and the 1TB HP EX920. This drive did come in first when tested using PCMARK 8 but the numbers were so close that I doubt it¡¯d matter in normal usage. I didn¡¯t notice a difference. This drive is supposed to have a better endurance rating so like I said earlier about specialized use cases this might benefit you there. So, in the end, I¡¯d recommend this drive and say to choose whatever drive that is priced the best at the time you are buying as long as it has the backing and warranty that you want.

"473" 473 "-Note: I didn't buy this on amazon-I did buy the laptop on Amazon if that counts..The 970pro is an awesome drive. I upgraded my 2.5 drive first to a 860evo, which was a great step up from the 5400rpm drive, especially with rapid. Then yesterday, I decided to upgrade my m.2 from the factory SanDisk 250g sata3 to the 970pro, I did have to get a 2.5 to m.2 case to clone the drive but all really went well.The 970pro really kicked my computer up a notch. Everything feels really snappy and quick. Almost too quick. But that's a good thing.. I am using this laptop as my personal workstation for work.. I have a program that I run for work and created a bench mark test that taxes all components... Cpu, ram, and storage(not gpu intensive at all). But what I have found is; stock form, my computer did one task in 3min 45seconds. After the 860, that went down to 3:15-3:30, and now I'm doing it in 2:45. A solid minute over stock, which is ~ 30% system improvement over stock.Boot time is down to almost half, 30seconds to 17seconds to log in screen.Laptop used is a Asus gl702zc with a ryzen 7 1700 and 32gb ram scoring around 1550 on cinebench. This computer is a power house now! Really happy with the performance of this drive. Wouldn't hesitate buying one again and I might if I decid to pull the trigger on a new nuc hades canyon..Ultimately all pcie m.2s are going to be, or should be, insanely fast but the 970pro is a no compromise ssd that you can trust every day.

"474" 474 "This is one incredibly fast SSD. I used a PCIe adapter card to mount it in my desktop PC (a rather ancient at this point Intel 3rd-Generation Core i7 processor) and ran tests using CrystalMark. I then compared the speed to that on the Intel 535 SSD of the same size used as the system disk (connected by SATA).At Queue Depth 32, the Samsung 870 achieved 3202MB/s for Sequential Read compared to 528 for the Intel 535. Sequential Write was 2537 vs, 257, nearly ten times faster.At Queue Depth 1 the Samsung's Random Read/Write speeds were 40/102 (MB/s) vs 24/24 for the Intel. SATA III is a nominal 6GB/s interface, so I don't think that was entirely the difference, but NVMe does have lower overhead.For comparison, I earlier tested another NVMe drive, a WD Black. Its sequential speeds were 1140/1120 and random speed 35/77, so the Samsung is still faster.The 970 Pro has no components on the back side of the card, so it should fit in even the lowest-clearance applications (laptops, typically.)

Blazing fast speed, much faster than I'm used to on my old (HDD based computer) and faster than using my 1TB EVO (which holds my operating system). Taking full advantage of my 8700k processor is important and I love how easy this is to work with even though I'm a non-professional relative novice (this was my first complete build).The included software provides very helpful information about the drive, and the cloning software works amazingly easy, so that you can spend time working not time fiddling about.Couldn't be happier and now to get back to work...

"476" 476 "I own a 2-3 year old Ultrabook with an older, too small for my needs M.2 MVMe PCIe drive and jumped on this chance to upgrade to a new high performance 512GB solid state drive. Installation was a bit complicated because there doesn¡¯t seem to be any readily available external USB enclosures for these M.2 MVMe PCIe drives - which would made for simple cloning of the existing M.2 drive. No problem, all that meant was that I just had to reload Windows and my applications from scratch. As fast as this drive is that really wasn¡¯t a problem. The bottom line is that this is a FAST! M.2 SSD drive from a tier-one manufacturer. Highly recommended for fresh builds and clean installation upgrades. " "July 15, 2018" "5.0"
"477" 477 "The 970 Pro series continues the refinement of NVMe M.2 technology. I don¡¯t think most of us (outside of heavy professional workloads) are able to perceive a real-world speed difference between the EVO and the Pro outside of benchmarking as both are very fast and reliable. But for my gaming and video editing needs, however, I am happy to have the fastest performance I can obtain. Moving to an NVMe SSD from a standard HDD, however, is quite noticeable speed-wise. Be sure to verify that your MB supports M.2 NVMe and Gen 3 PCIe. If you don¡¯t need the bleeding edge technology (and increased speed) the Samsung EVO is also amazingly fast and somewhat cheaper.

"478" 478 "I recently bought a ThinkPad X1 Carbon (6th Generation; i5 8350U, 16gb RAM, WQHD display) and just installed one of these Samsung 970 PROs in it, and man, the reviews did not lie. This thing is so, so, so fast. Laptop goes from the push of the power button to fully booted - all startup program running *and* a dozen Chrome tabs open - in 15 and a half seconds.I cloned my old drive using Macrium Reflect (the free version) and it couldn't have been easier. I did need to buy an m.2 to USB converter stick thingy (about 30$ here on Amazon) in order to do so, but given how lightning fast this computer is now, I'd say it's worth it.The real proof in the pudding here is that with older machines and SSDs, my default behavior when I'd want to stop using the laptop was to close the lid, putting into sleep. Shutting it down fully would always take too much time, and I didn't want to wait. Now, though, I shut down the computer fully because the thing boots so quickly. I'm saving a lot of battery.10/10 would recommend " "January 1, 2019" "5.0"

Research to find the right parts for your needs, and plug it in - not too hard ;)And this is one of those Right Parts. Going from an HDD to this makes an easily-noticeable difference in speed. Very impressive. I have a pet peeve about startup times, and this is fast enough to make me fall in love.Check MB compatibility, but that should be a given.Impressive 5 year warranty as well, and that's a big deal in the computer periphs world, I think.I do a lot of photo editing, working in .tiffs, and the load speed increase is another plus thing for me.Being able to ditch some cables in another plus for me. I happen to be allergic to dust, and a tower is pretty much a dust magnet around here, so I clean it pretty regularly. Cables always make that quite a bit harder to do.I'll certainly update if anything hinky pops up, but at this point I couldn't be more pleased.Don't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many things you buy every day will generate a small donation to the charity of your choice.

"482" 482 "Installs really easily - check that your motherboard supports it. This is a TINY drive that requires an M.2 slot on your motherboard. M.2 is the form factor. If your motherboard supports M.2 then you should be good, although you may not get fastest speeds unless it also supports NVMe.If you're just adding to an existing rig, I recommend the Disk Management tool that's built into windows, to add a partition and format.I'm still using it and comparing it to my older SSD. So far the general usage times are noticeably faster than my Samsung 850 EVO 250GB, which uses the older SATA interface and form factor.500GB is good for your primary volume and a most apps, but probably not for a full Steam library or a lot of media. At around $200 it's probably the sweet spot if you don't mind some active management of your drives.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this as a workhorse main drive. If you're building a tiny PC (I'm not, this is a full size desktop) then you get extra value from the tiny size.Note - it doesn't come with an anchoring screw, so dig out the screws from your motherboard, or be ready to go hunting!s exactly what we were looking for and we had no problems with its use.

No, you are not going to \"feel\" a lot of difference between these two drives, but the numbers do not lie. This is a much faster drive. As one reviewer commented, it is best to install this with a clean install of WIndows, with the drive formatted for GPT and not MBR in a UFEI BIOS. I have had this drive for about 3 months, and it is performing flawlessly. My games load extremely fast, and and large file transfers do not bog this drive down. For most applications, the 970 EVO would have been a more economical choice with no noticeable slowdown, but I wanted an MLC drive, and I am not sure that the Intel Optane is quite worth it for even faster speeds.

In the midst of that this 970 Pro showed up for review and I knew it was worth the tax hit to take it (Vine stuff isn't really free, lol). I made it my C drive in the dedicated PCIe 4x M.2 slot on the motherboard. I used userbenchmark dot com to get results. The results were beyond amazing:Rank 4 - 335%Read 2,352Write 1,966Mixed 1,294SusWrite 1,860419% 1,868 MB/sCopying a 5GB video file from this drive to another SSD I nearly 2gbB/sec, just crazy. Speeds like that are really needed in multitrack audio and MIDI orchestration where we are reading 1TB libraries of orchestral samples from other SDs on the system, and then the system needs to play everything back in real time. That's where the Samsung 970 Pro is worth its weight in gold 10 times over, there's no more hard drive bottle neck which MIDI composers even got from SATA SSDs. Being able to run dozens of tracks in Studio One with a low bit rate and have no crackle and 4ms latency is pretty crazy (that will mean something to audio engineers and MIDI composers). Video editing now, with my Assets on another 970 non Pro, is equally amazing. Full HD video renders in way less time that real time in Premiere Pro, even with multiple plugins. So I would have to say that gamers would benefit hugely as well, because the OS layer has always been choked by the C drive, and that's not a limitation any longer. The technology isn't cheap but it's already cheaper than 18 months ago. But even using this as a data drive when you have to stream in assets will be phenomenally faster (scenery for games, video for editing, samples for audio, etc). For those who do MIDI composing, I have the Pro for C drive and the non Pro 970 for libraries, and I can load a 70 seat orchestral patch from the full NI Symphony Series in under 3 seconds. When you need speed, SATA SSDs are just standard now, not exciting, the NVMe SSDs are worth every penny.
