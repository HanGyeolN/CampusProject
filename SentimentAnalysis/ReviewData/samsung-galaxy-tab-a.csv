0,"Got this for my little girl and she loves it. Use it for watching kid shows and drawings.I'll say it's pretty decent tablet for kid nowadays, does it job by keeping them entertained."
1,Very good tablet for the price. I still have this tablet. It is not very fast but you get what you pay for. It is inexpensive and daily use tablet.
2,"Perfect for what I need and perfect size. I think the only thing I would indicate here is that the tablet's system and software already occupies 4.5+GB of memory so out of 16GB, you only truly get around 11."
3,"This is a great tablet if you can get it for around ~$250. Great for basic usage, e.g. browsing, social media, media playback. It's a got a decently vibrant screen and long battery life. Feels a bit cheap as it's a plastic chassis, but I don't notice it with a case on. Speakers and camera are terrible as expected."
4,Reliable and easy to use for the kids and link to gmail account. Kids use it gor games and mathonline. They love it much easier then ipad. More reliable.and would recommend it.
5,Coming to a larger Samsung screen has made such a difference from my old leveno 8inch tablet.Full HD resolution plus surround sound speakers make it the perfect movie /Netflix /YouTube machine.
6,"Specs are on the high side, 3gb of ram should do for a mid size tablet and it is still getting Google security updates."
7,Can't recommend this tablet enough. I even bought my neighbour one the day after I ordered mine!
8,"Features are poor, runs slowly and does not support a stylus, decent as a kids throw away if you can get it at a good enough size, would not recommend for any other purpose"
9,"My daughter's Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7"" was 14 months old. She plugged it in to charge overnight and it caught on fire. Smoke alarms went off and woke us up. The house reeked of burning plastic."
10,On the phone Samsung said all the right things and said to return it to them for review and replacement under warranty. Now they're saying that because i used a third party charger the warranty is void and I'll need to pay $300 to repair a $150 tablet.I value my child's safety and will not be purchasing or recommending Samsung products to anyone.
11,"What's the point of buying a tablet if you can't even log into it? I have gone through 3 of these tablets since the end of November, each has had the same issue, I have been using it go away to do something else and then I can't log into it. This is a faulty product, each has lasted around 2 months before breaking, I've returned each one, this was the last one I was going to try and it worked fine until about an hour ago, now I can't even log into it. Samsung needs to fix this issue, as it is a frustrating and a pain to keep having to return them. I also left a review for the Samsung Northland store, where I was told that the only way to fix my tablet was to pay $60, not good customer service."
12,My old tablet finally died and I got the new Tab A from JB. Better screen and faster than the old one. Great for streaming and browsing. Definitely a good buy at the price.
13,I bought this tablet second hand unopened for $100. Far from amazing but is sufficient for a multimedia tablet.
14,Pros:-Good battery life (due to lower res)-Runs Oreo-Runs smooth and reliably as a multimedia tablet-SD Card and SIM slots.
15,"Cons:-Just a standard HD display-Not a particularly sensitive display-Small screen for a tablet-Low internal space much less than 16GB-Poor cameras-Permanent hard navigation buttons-Not really great for high spec games-Can't see/locate navigation buttons in poor light (my biggest gripe, ended up painting dots on buttons with a marker)"
16,Most of the cons are due to known specifications so if you still buy it you can't really complain. You couldn't compare it to flagship phone rather a lower end mid range device.I would recommend this tablet if you can find it for the right price.
17,"I was used to a Samsung 8.2 but the battery died after 3 years.  Tried an Aldi Tablet for $99 & that was quite a disappointment, BUT compared to this one .. it was a real gem!  I couldn't do anything with this as more than half of the 8Gb was taken up with essential running s'ware so I couldn't add photos or anything else with it!  All I wanted was for podcasts but it was so totally useless that I couldn't even put my favourite playlists, let alone trying to download even one short story & certainly no more than even three photos!  Couldn't add OneNote, Messenger which is something that I was used to using on my 8.2"" so I added a 32GB sim but I couldn't even add what I needed to the card.  I had to return it ... & now purchased a Lenovo which appears better already!  Fortunately Officeworks was great about giving me a full refund."
18,"We had a Tab 3 10.1 for a few years it was too big for around the house, so I bought the Tab A 7.0""."
19,It was one of my worser purchases I have made.
20,Samsung now fall into the same boat as Apple who use abuse brand loyal customers pockets by using average hardware at top end prices.
21,For the same price you can get a lenovo tablet with much better hardware specs.
22,"Pros:- 7"" screen is good size for around the house."
23,"Cons:- I have google wifi and can test wifi the speed of all my devices connect to it individually, my robot vac has a faster wifi bandwidth than the tablet and it doesn't even need to use much data.- CPU is slow (takes ages to open apps).- 1.5GB RAM is ok but not great.- 8GB of storage is only enough to install about 5-8 apps and even then some can't update coz all the storage has been used. Most apps won't let you run them on the SD which you don't want to do anyway coz it would make them slow."
24,"[I note your notice""Listing monitored by samsung representatives"" below my review on here.Pitty the ceos dont monitor all the complaints before one takes the step of airing samsung's ""Dirty laundry"" via this reputable platform]."
25,I'm amazed (and somewhat gobsmacked) that 90 percent of reviews on here are POSITIVE!
26,"If theres trouble with one of two identical tablets purchased  one can assume its a rotten apple in the bunch, but to have TWO with the same problems with their software outlined below, one begins to SMELL RAT!And the rat's stench is even stronger when Samsung refuses to address the issue!Which is the bigger rat!!!"
27,"I have made the mistake of purchasing two of these samsung ""SMT-355Y  Galaxy tab A""   temperamental misfits,(Android version 7.1.1,  security patch level 1 august 2017).Build dates:  23 june 2017  emeisv 07 and 22 august 2017 emeisv 06."
28,The biggest sd card these can handle (although inconveniently not specified in any of their documentation) is 256gig!Persons at technical support even give one differing answers to the maximum size sd card one can use because it is not documented anywhere...  (crazy but true).These tablets use the android (google) platform.There is 11.07gig of space on the internal storage card of which samsung/google use about 6gig for god knows what.
29,"You get 2gig of Memory of which SAMSUNG and bedfellows (C.I.A) GOOGLE use 1.2 gig plus to run its shoddy BACKGROUND software, making it difficult for one to go into websites with alot of 'active' content, gif and flash file content etc.Takes ages to browse through The Good Guys website for example waiting for everything to load because these vermin are using most of the ram for THEIR benefit!"
30,"Speaking of which, SAMSUNGs third world software does not even play GIF images!!Check these things folks before you purchase their showpony Galaxy S10."
31,"Processors are slow, takes forever to even delete one gigabite of data on the emeisv 06.Takes ages to transfer data, folders and especially movies from the internal storage to the sd storage, even transferring movies to folders within the sd card at times is a slow process;  again, slow or ""Tired"" processing power."
32,"One constantly does battle with the spellchecker continually changing what you type!I type in ""The hollies"" and these clowns give me ""The jollies"", after re-typing  ""The hollies"" it finally gives in!!  What more can one say...You cannot turn this (so called) ""Feature"" (being unable to use expletives) off!It's a ripe royal pain in the peter dutton!!!!"
33,"Samsung only do updates on the software for these tablets to accommodate advertisers or google!(not for the customers who have purchased outright  these items for our  private use, and I emphasize our private use)."
34,"These are nothing more than an advertising platform to fill samsung's pockets and probably fill google's intel collection database!(I cite the recent case of the $6.8 billion google was fined by the european courts for its mobile app's hanky panky with the europeans being the only country to take them to the cleaners thus far.  Search yahoo for ""Google fined billion europe court"" for all the nitty gritty)."
35,"Speaking of which, SYNC pops up all the time after reboot with ""too many contact deletions"" ever since all my PERSONAL PRIVATE 380 odd contacts were COPIED last June or July.I have tried to delete these unwanted, unrequested copies of my Personal private information ever since to no avail.Again pushing thick pea soup through a thin plastic  straw with Samsungs technical support, and Im not giving up on this!"
36,"SAMSUNG (or its main bedfellow GOOGLE) are'nt messing with this lil' duck's  PRIVATES!!!This is still being investigated.I urge anyone with privacy concerns similar to these to contact the Privacy Commissioner or/and a good pro-bono lawyer!I also STRONGLY urge folks that want to back up their contacts by copying the ""contacts"" under Apps to USB not let Google upload a (so called) back-up to its servers.Remember, This is your personal information we are talking about here! and email addresses can be sold on by companies for up to 2 bucks a pop (or more) these days!"
37,"Samsung wont update their media player to play certain movie and music formats, or provide common audio and video codecs to play  all media eg m4a vob mov avi aac mpeg 1,2 mkv etc."
38,Then there's the audio codecs!Some mp4 files that do play visually on these have  audio codecs that are not supported on these tablets yet these same files play quite happily on the crappy cheap and nasty konka r8a mobile phone!(see my review on here on konka r8a to get a picture of just how sad this really is)
39,"The media player does not show all my music files, where other non samsung players do!The last media player update they did was for the benefit of spotify!Not to benefit the customer.Again, I have been on to customer support about this to no avail."
40,Samsung adding insult to injury recently updatedSmart switch a program that was working fine and did everything it was meant to do..  It did - really!
41,"Before they stuffed it up with the recent update, we knew the size of the files being transferred and the rest of it, no connection problems between the other samsung tablet or crabby konka, no drop off's,  and now...  Sweet diddly squat!"
42,"Now several times after the update I'm having trouble connecting up smart switch between my two tablets.I get the ""Try again"" treatment.At times after numerous attempts when one finally succeeds in getting the two tablets together one or the other disconnects!What  a joke!"
43,"Quite a few times since this so-called update I'm rowin up the ross river with tenis rackets trying to transfer movies from one smt355y to my other smt355y!They are both the same tablet, the only difference is one's build date is one month older than the other, and before this update on smart switch I never had any problem!"
44,I do not use blutooth to transfer files and music from one tablet to another because it is so slow!
45,"Also,"
46,When you transfer some music files and especially some pdf files via bluetooth from one tablet to another the names change!  They lose their (dot)pdf and (dot)mp4 etcetera at the end of their file names which by-the-way have changed to a number now!
47,"Also,"
48,"In their contacts they give us an 8 inch screen yet when we hit the contact we are after, the left full half of the screen still shows up all the contacts you did not choose!W h y ?Because of this on the right hand half of the screen we only have 1 (one) iddy-biddy inch of space (horizontal use) (yes one inch of the eight) under the chosen contacts photo to scroll the phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses and websites etcetera.You know how annoying that is!"
49,"All other non samsung contact apps, when you hit the desired contact  that contact's details takes up the major portion of the page!Unlike with samsungs rubbish, all the other contacts that you did not choose do not inconveniently take up half the page!!"
50,"With non samsung contacts apps you have the full 8 inches to comfortably view all the numbers etc, not one inch!"
51,This was another matter I continually reported to samsung to no avail.They were just not interested.There have been 4 updates for contacts since and non have addressed this issue.Obviously common sense plays no part in the development of samsung apps.
52,"Then theres the wifi.My tablets are connected to the internet via wifi from my phone.Everytime I reboot the phone or tablets one must physically reconnect the wifi, the ""Auto reconnect"" is a tempramental feature (for want of a better word) that seldom works properly at the best of times even with all my tablets phones etc etc within a 10 foot desk radius!!The WiFi connection from my phone to these tablets cuts out a lot and when I check the WiFi it says ""Authentication Error"", which is very strange as this happens on both tablets at different times for no reason.Like a couple of samsung's other programs on these tablets, they seem to get their ""Monthly's"" on a daily basis!!"
53,"I have so many other beefs with these ""I-dont-give-a-hoot"" samsung mob that I won't have the space to outline them all via this platform!"
54,"I have contacted customer support many many many times about getting them to update their software (like microsoft and other reputable caring companies do all the time), to no avail."
55,"All you get is sorry, sorry, sorry and yes - more sorry!Their eyes and ears are closed to our complaints.We purchased their ""Product"" now we can go to hell is their motto!"
56,"I recently purchased thousands of dollars worth of fisher and paykel pidgeon pair fridge freezer, washing machine, heat pump drier etc (see upcoming reviews after I get a chance to use them all for a while after I get back on me feet)."
57,"The salesman at the good guys here in townsville tried to sell me samsung washers etc!(yeah right).As I explained, if one gets the same level of attention and satisfaction from samsung after buying one or more of their white goods as you do after buying two of their tablets they're not worth a cracker to me!"
58,"I showed him on my tablet the troubles im having with samsung tablets (with other customers looking on) and one really did not have any need to clarify too much after that I can tell you!I will not even look in the direction of any samsung product in the future!I have written samsung off as a bad joke, (a punishment from god) and am waiting for a (non apple) alternative to replace these, and this at a time where today's mobile phone or tablet is tomorrows paper weight, I dont mind waiting!"
59,"I would also like to add that I have video evidence to back everything I have stated above, I only wish I could show all you folks reading this what I continually show others here in townsville and other mediums.See some of my videos herehttps://youtu.be/2taE5YanQ1sand go to my profile page and you can see more."
60,(And MORE proof for Product Review.com.au of ownership of these bundles of joy one hopes).
61,"Im in the process of uploading about 30 videos about thes tablets software issues that Samsung refuse to fix onto a website that will be able to show them in HD, as they lose 80 percent clarity in  YouTubes upload and conversion process."
62,"For the months of anguish these corporates have caused me, when next in Sydney these tablets of mine will transform into ""Special tablets"" for certain samsung ceos, and the good ol' aussie slang term of  ""Gettin it up em"" will have a whole new meaning after I'm done, then they'll have one ""Eye"" wide open to future complaints, and I shant be wasting any money on vaseline for that privilege!"
63,"Wont be no ""Sorrys"" from me either!"
64,I have enclosed a hi res photo of my two tablets showing tablet info including my IP address and Tablet serial numbers etc.
65,"UPDATE 18 MARCH 2019,One has noticed a lack of reply of any description from  ""Samsung representatives that are monitoring this listing"" (as stated above and below).WONDER WHY?????"
66,PeterTownsville
67,Works in some instances but not in the nursing home where it needs to work for translation purposes we have tried by resetting back to factory default at least 4 timesUnit works until I turn it off and then back it says I have a wifi connection but we can’t get internet to use google translate appHave tried Samsung support and chat line for approx.2hours and quite frankly the responses are a joke and attempts to resolve issue were futileI had a 3pm phone booking to discuss today and was rung at 2.10pm when I was not at the nursing home apparently due to “training “ and we’re unable to assistWhy was that not mentioned when I booked the return call 2 days earlierIt is now 2 weeks since we bought tablet and have not been able to use it at allBack to the retailer for a replacement
68,"Picked up a new Galaxy Tab A 8 through a telstra deal and we're extremely happy with it. Share it with the wife and we both use it for easy internet access and apps throughout the house.  Screen is sharp and easy to read, plenty of processing power to run all the apps we need and has a sleek and shiny finish!"
69,"I use this tablet for work and sometimes watching movies. I use a few apps and it doesn't get used as much as my phone, The screen clarity is exceptional and the battery lasts a really long time which I love. It only gets charged once a week. The only issue I have is I haven't found a way to connect a keyboard, and sometimes when you click in a field to add text the keyboard doesn't pop up or is very slow to respond.I do believe I could take to samsung and have fixed but haven't done so.The screens are very expensive to replace in comparison to apple devices so put a case on it."
70,"Was looking for a tablet computer, and was horrified at the cost of them- some exceeding 1k!!Came across this at target for $250AUD- was a bit worried about the the quality of this item due to the low price,but 2 years later and I am still getting good performance out of this item for emails, Netflix, and web browsing.For the price, Samsung have delivered an EXCEPTIONAL product here."
71,"That said, it is not a high end or super high performance tablet- those looking to multitask and run high powered apps may want to up their budget a little."
72,I purchased this tablet for my daughter. It's a good sturdy tablet. Affordable price. I think its best option for the money. Works great with kids youtube app and android kids apps. High resolution screen. Easy to use if you already own some Samsung phones like me . Long lasting battery. Everything works great. Very happy with it's performance:)
73,"At Harvey's we bought the new Galaxy tab A 10.5"" screen for my mother..  It is perfect for Mum for  the games and facebook. Now mum can play and enjoy her ipad again. The last one was an LG so when the battery went in it there was no easy replacement"
74,"This Tab does not have phone connection, just wifi,  but it is just what Mum needed. It  does not lag or go slow, and even my mother could catch on how to use it in no time despite her memory problems. . The android system is one Mum is familiar with, which helped in deciding which to buy. The screen is lovely crispy clear - a bit bigger than the old 2 Mum had. Overall this is something I would buy myself due to the sufficiency of the speed."
75,It actually feels very very nice in the hand. I purchased a cover to protect it against drops etc and now Mum takes it with her everywhere. The battery holds a pretty good charge.. The internet is fast enough for mum. Mainly just  for emails and youtube. and really there are no complaints to be reported. This is a neat tablet and I recommend it.  Very pleased with the purchase.
76,"Samsung Tab A is perfect for my kid to use.  Just the right size (8 inches) not too big not too small for my 6 yr old to play with.  Weight wise it is also excellent - not heavy for a 6yr old.  it also has good battery life for my kid to play with it for a long time and charging time is also not an issue, as it charges fast."
77,"Because it is android, it has heaps of apps for kids and easily connects to PC and TV (screen mirroring) so it is great connectivity wise."
78,"Bought the galaxy tab A Wi-Fi tablet with the 10.5inch screen.  Used it to replace a older smaller tablet.  Using it to watch videos on you tube,  play games, internet browsing and emails. Very happy with it.  Works well,  heaps of memory and runs all the apps I need without any issue.  Battery life is great which is handy as has been used during long car trips for the kids to watch movies on.  Fast boot up when turned on is handy as sometimes I've needed to quickly do something and don't want to be waiting ages for it to start up."
79,It is very easy to use and fast. I use it for reading books and I am very happy with it.I have all the my applications such as skype and camscanner on it so I do not need to have them on my mobile.I use it to review my studies when I am in the bus after work.
80,Nice device to use and carry about not too big but plenty of real estate to use and see at great ease. Battery life is very good as well. Crisp and clear screen with great automatic contrast and brightness control takes care of changing things when you move into a dim room.device speed is get too.
81,I use this tablet to watch Netflix and Youtube picture is perfect and the audio is exceptional. High recommend.
82,The battery life is also a pleasant surprise. Lasts long and charges using quick charge and it takes three hours to fully charge.
83,I got mine on sale for $340.. bargain.
84,"This tablet  satisfy my daily needs,  it works very smoothly with a lots of common apps and sync all my emails accounts. Casting you tube video on my smart TV was easy. We found this tablet to be good value for money.The model maybe year 2016 but the Android version is one of the latest updated version. The sound quality is rather  flat but when we cast it on TV, it does not matter cos we are watching it on TV. For the price we pay we are getting many beautiful moments using this tablet. We are just one of the many who appreciate this Samsung Tablet."
85,"My 4 year old autistic son uses his Samsung Galaxy Tab everyday. There is no problem with the apps,the visuals are great and boy that tab has taken a beating being dropped ,had water and other liquids on it and never missed a beat.l consider it a really trusted product of high quality."
86,Got this from Telstra. It's a great tablet for everyday personal use. Using this for 10 months now and haven't had any issues so far. Value for money. Good battery life (12 -14 hours) and enough storage. Quality rear camera and loved the pictures. Easy to carry design and totally love the product.
87,"Samsung has done it's homework on producing this tablet which should be a big seller for them. Large screen, long lasting battery, ample storage with SD card and excellent sound. I also have a laptop but this provides everything required with more portability. It provides very good picture and sound for viewing movies. Has only been released recently and competes well on price and it does all things the majority of tablet buyers are looking for."
88,The good The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is affordably priced and offers many premium app perks for free. Its microSD slot accommodates cards up to 128GB.
89,"The bad The plastic construction feels cheap, and the single speaker provides weak audio. The text often appears pixelated."
90,"The bottom line The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is a simple tablet worth picking up for its low price, and its valuable extras sweeten the deal even more."
91,"This tablet does all the things without lagging much after a year or so. The small HDD size is easy to cope with. The thing is sleek and cleans up well. The bloatware doesn't get in the way much and the battery still seems alright, Accubattery says, ""91% heath based on 86 sessions with 4,957%% charged for 224,356mAh total."""
92,We purchased two of these tablets for our children to use. They are fast to switch on and operate. We have never had any WIFI connectivity issues. The screen is large and easy to use. The picture is excellent quality. Camera takes excellent photos too. Overall a great value tablet costing $299 each.
93,"I've had my Samsung tablet for a couple of years now and its never played up.  The battery still holds enough charge to last a whole day of continual use (though I have the screen brightness turned down).  It sometimes restarts if I play heavy duty games on it, but it handles most simple games and can multitask (run Netflix and games at the same time).  I know some Samsung products have had a bad wrap lately but I can't say anything negative about my tablet.  It's great, and I'd buy another one tomorrow if I needed too."
94,Bought this machine 2 years ago and does everything need. I use it for work and play. I take it everywhere with me. Its size and weight are great and its easily stored in my laptop bag. The screen is great quality and the apps are easy to use. Highly recommended.
95,I'm sorry to say that I'm really disappointed with this model...at times seems very sluggish loading my apps...it does the job but I brought this so I didn't have to use my main computer... for me it doesn't measure up to what I wanted yet is ok for my games & quick searching on the net... for the price it's quite an expensive item for playing games...
96,"I only use this tablet to play games and watch netflix. I have had this for a year now and it still works as good as new. The battery life is extremely long even when I am watching videos which is good! I like that the screen is very big and the tablet doesn't have a huge border, the camera is good for general picture taking that I do."
97,"I normally use my tablet for day to day work, now as converting over to apple I’ll never convert my tablets, as I said apple dose offer hire sercurity but for everyday to day use I’ll go android all the way. It runs perfectly and have never had any issues."
98,"This is a good, reliable tablet.  The screen resolution and colours are very good. It takes as good a photo as a tablet will. The storage space is very limited for me which is annoying. This would probably not be an issue for someone not wanting to install games as these will be limited.  It suits my needs well though and charges quickly.  I would recommend.  We have several of these in our family and all are going strong with heavy use."
99,Great tablet with expandable storage. Very easy to use and I have dropped many times and it still is in one piece.It is quick in its processes but occasionally does lag sometimes when playing gamesGreat for business use or for personal and it is user friendly.Heaps of apps are compatible to the Samsung Galaxy tabA.Great for kids or Adults
100,"Love it as an eReader and for games and puzzles, very handy size. But Samsung has too much bloatware, apps I don't want. Hard to update my apps because I get messages to delete some apps to make room. I have Force stopped a few of the inbuilt apps to get around it. My 16GB phone has no problems, and I wish I'd bought a brand without so much bloatware. Won't be buying Samsung again because of that."
101,I love my tablet so much because I no longer have to cart my Lap Top around with me. It does everything my Laptop does. I can access all my apps with no problems at all. I can access my Netflix account and download movies and watch them anywhere. Also comes in very handy when on holidays to pay bills and check emails.
102,"I don't like Apple products and prefer android, this being Samsung has a more functional layout compared to the standard android. The battery life is excellent and having the battery still like new even though the family uses it every day. I'd recommend and would buy again its a good thing"
103,"I have taken this tablet all around the world. It was been all around Australia. I have a good cover for protection. I have had it for 4 years. I use it for shopping,  taking photographs, video, study,  socially, collecting my photos, reading and watching programs. I would be lost without it. Fits perfectly into my hand bag. I use it to skype call my friends. In the kitchen to listen to music or watch cooking shows on you tube. Small memory and not a very loud speaker."
104,I usually only buy apple products as my phone is an iPhone but overall i have been very happy with this Samsung tablet. Like the iPad this Samsung tablet is very lightweight and has a nice sleek design. I also found this Samasung tablet to be very affordable in comparison to iPads and have had no issues with its performance and battery life so far.
105,Easy to use much easier then Apple iPadKid friendly especially for them playing different games and educational appsI use it for work and Markets to run my small businessesEasy to upload apps and play gamesCan connect to different sources including square deviceBattery lasts for day or two depending
106,Wow I remember the first Samsung tablet i bought back in the day which was super slow but the new A tab is 20x faster and can run a lot more apps. The design hasn't changed much but the weight has heaps and holding it feels great and not heavy. The screen display is outstanding too
107,"Does an excellent job as a small and basic tablet in my opinion. Can view and share my files, emails, photos, access Wi-Fi anywhere. Nice for occasionally watching catchup tv on iview when away, really works well for reading books and playing music. I would recommend getting a good cover to keep it from damage, one that is easy to access rear camera."
108,"Mainly used for surfing the Net, watching movies and emails. Out of the box the Samsung Tab A was easy to setup and has heaps of pre-loaded apps but if you need more specialty type apps you can download from Google Playstore. Movies and pictures look great on the 10.1” screen. Sound from the tablet is only so so but a good set of ear/headphones will enhance your movie or tunes experience. Battery life is excellent."
109,"I recently bought the Samsung galaxy tablet for my kids to keep them entertained on long car rides or while doing the the groccery shopping i wish i had bought one earlier would have saved me jours of frustration... i love the fact its easy to use and am able to put on movies shows very easy, the kids mode is great tbe kids c asn not get out of the mode without a password and wont play around on other apps when un supervised. The size is perfect highly recommended the 10"", also love the fact you can buy sd card to expand the memory"
110,Amazing the best of the best and you will not regret it is the beat and it is the best and you will not regret it and it is the best. I don't want to sell it because it's new and has third party apps available to you to use and I think they should do more of these tablets out there. This really satisfied my needs of work and even making a movie. I really enjoy what I use on this. Simple to use and you can access your files from there easily and can edit documents. iOS systems can’t do that that’s why I love the Tab A. Also my friend recommended me this tablet and so I bought it. But I didn’t know it was this good. You guys who are reading this should really get this or maybe a newer version of the Tablets made by Samsung. Great work I love it.
111,"I have had this table for the past 18 months and even though I brought it second hand,it does exactly what I want and need.I have a case for it,BUT no sim,so I rely on wifi to use it.Ovverall I have no complaints with it and even though its been discontinued,its like a Toyota motor car,its keeps on keeping on.Well done to Samsung for a good and reliable product"
112,This was a very much appreciated Christma gift. Its already been with me up and back the east coast of Australia and made a superb travelling companion. Its got a lovely vibrant screen and the processing power to match. It replaced an old Telstra branded tablet that was well past due and so the upgrade is still very obvious to me. I can't think of anything I would change - I am very pleased with it.
113,"Great product, decent picture quality and graphics, sound quality is good. Easy to operate, plenty of storage space, great touch screen. Hardly use my laptop anymore as this is so handy and easy,  kids love it and can navigate through screens easily, i see the "" it's not an ipad"" comments and no it isn't,  i think it's better and alot more budget friendly"
114,"As the title says, the 8Gb model is very low on storage space and I get a msg almost on a daily basis. Even after deleting many files it keeps saying storage space low and asks to delete files from My Files. In spite of putting an extra SD card, it would not automatically send files to the SD.  But other aspects of the tablet are very good - it is light, quick, good resolution and user-friendly."
115,"After buying the tablet l got rid of my laptop as l wasn't using it. So handy to just reach for the tablet when l need to check emails,Google or type a document  and use my wireless printer.It fits in my handbag so l can take it on trains etc and watch a movie. I love it."
116,"It’s extremely slow and I all I have on it is 2 apps that I downloaded and 7 photos. It’s been this way since purchase and when I took it in to see what was wrong with it, I was told it was in perfect working condition. The keyboard is so slow that I may as well be typing backwards. The apps and pages that I attempt to open take anywhere between 45 seconds - 4 minutes to actually do so, sometimes not at all. It has a decent battery life but if it turns on it takes so long to turn back on. The sensitivity of the screen is also extremely insensitive. I basically have to hit the screen as hard as I would knocking on a door for it to register what I press. I’ve had other Samsung tablets in the past which were decent. This one just isn’t. If it was faulty I would understand I just got a bad one but being told it was working perfectly... I believe it’s a dud of a tablet. After having purchased this and the s6, I have now turned to Apple products in hopes of a better experience"
117,"I find the touch screen isn't that good and it lags. It also shuts down apps often when it freezes up. I don't use it much for this reason. Internal storage is also very low and you cannot store much on this device, as is. I would not recommend buying this is you want something that is reliable and fast, for lots of use. I love my Lenovo Yoga Book, awesome tablet!!"
118,"First IPad I have purchased. Wanted something easy to use, access internet and emails on the run. Samsung products easy to use a with back up customer support. No longer need a laptop computer as Samsung Galaxy Tab A provides most functions.Will continue to use Samsung products when upgrading or purchasing new products."
119,"Ive had this for just over a week... between the tablet and my laptop I have completely replaced all my paper notebooks (and textbooks too since most can be found as an ebook). Has been reliable, and the battery lasts an entire day of uni note-taking and googling and netflix and then some.Super handy and the S-pen is great, just a little small so writing non-stop for over an hr might make your hand sore. I was concerned about the pen lagging in lectures but it has kept up amazingly. I have a problem in One-note when resting my palm on the screen, in which it sometimes scrolls the page as I put my hand down and I miss the line.... but I don't think that's unique to this tablet. Would love to get some sort of grip to put around the S-pen so that I can hold it properly and potentially eliminate this problem, otherwise pulling up my sleeve a bit helps too. Using the S-pen is also kind of addictive. Maybe that's just me.Screen is probably just a little too large to read novels on, but the size is great cos I can split the screen so I have a writing page and a lecture notes or textbook page open at the same time, which is great when I'm at uni and don't have my computer's second screen to read off.I bought a 64GB sd card which I've downloaded my textbooks and teachers notes onto so I don't have to rely on wifi; I could have bought a sim for it but couldn't be bothered considering I don't go many places without wifi anyway.For AUD$550 I suppose the price is reasonable, cheap even, though a little more than I originally wanted to pay. I have no regrets now. I was considering the Surface Go but for what I'm doing the extra $400 or so was totally not worth it.I definitely recommend this for students; any student, really. As an engineering student I would never rely on a tablet for some of the software anyway so the fact that it's not super powerful is not ever going to be a problem.This tablet is great as a complementary device along with a laptop for the more demanding things. MS Office works well and I am a huge fan of the Samsung OS. Would love to see it get more updates; both software and newer models (this is a 2016 model! Practically ancient lol)"
120,"This tablet is great, its so easy to set up and navigate, you honestly cant go wrong with it. I am an amature with technology and I have been able to download apps and really enjoy what this tablet can offer. I would definatly reccommend it, you will not be dissappointed"
121,"My partner brought me a Samsung Tablet for work, it’s okay but it’s not great, it regularly freezes in the middle of trying to do anything, I have to “turn it off and on again” when requesting help from the provider, I definitely wouldn’t go buy one myself Id be more inclined to buy an iPad because it’s more reliable!"
122,"Really easy U.I, great charging speeda and battery life. Can spend moat of the day browsing memes or watching youtube vidyas without having to plug in the charger. The specs aren't high-end but aren't really needed for this device. Most gamea play well, a few will require a drop in graphics settings but most will run fine"
123,"Was looking for a good reliable 7"" android tablet and this was probably the best. Have had other brands like Lenovo and Asus in the past but this is way better. Has decent amount of memory (1.5GB RAM ) and powerful enough cpu to do most things. Mainly use it for browsing the web and social media so can't comment on how well it does on graphics intensive games. Screen is bright enough - although Full HD would have been great. Only real annoyance is that the speaker is on the back so you lose most of the sound out the back."
124,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is reasonably priced and offers many premium Samsung app perks for free. Its MicroSD slot accommodates an expandable storage of 256GB. Unfortunately the plastic construction does feel somewhat cheap (albeit sturdy), and the audio from a single speaker system is quite weak (best using headphones or a blue tooth speaker with this one). The display holds up well, however for the best experience I would recommend loading a custom OS to this tablet."
125,"The wife really surprised be with this. She usually has no interest of any kind in tech but she knew I would like it. The reason I wanted Samsung? The screen. Its just beautiful compared to its lesser rivals. Its also light weight. That's important too because I enjoy watching Netflix on it and you can be a t all sorts of odd angles. Battery life is superb and it has enough processing power and RAM to get everything done effortlessly. I am 100% happy with this tablet, just love it!"
126,"Bought this item to watch movies while travelling. Clear, decent sized screen and has good case options. Definitely happy with this purchase and would recommend samsung to anyone. This tablet is a good option for movie watching, book reading and game playing. Is a good price for what you get."
127,Seriously Omg its actually the Best quality tablet I've ever owned ever.. i dont think ill ever upgrade again. Im absolutely in love lolI would recommend this to family and friends for sure
128,"Good price point, good size and weight for 6 year old child. It is useful being wifi only as you can restrict internet access. The kids mode looks interesting but I haven't trialled that. However it is very fast and convenient to set up when you first purchase this tablet."
129,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab A in order to attend to my daily business transactions as invoicing clients, purchasing business related materials  and attending quickly to my emails,etc..........Good size & light weight, stylish, and so convenient in my daily bag.Absolutely Happy with the purchase all the way"
130,"I bought this tablet for my kid to browse and watch you tube and add on some learning apps, I added extra memory with SD card and hard case to avoid cracking of screen, once its covered it working awesome for kids with lots of storage with SD card and plenty of learning apps,"
131,even battery life is good if not great. works atleast 8 hrs with full charge
132,I have a Galaxy tab A and it is one of the best things j have ever brought it's bullet proof no matter what I do to it it doesn't brake. The camera on it is pretty good. I love being able to put a SD card in if I want more storage it is a life saver.
133,I find this tablet very useful for my studies. It is reasonably light. It is typically fast to start up and open apps. The battery is quite good and typically lasts for 8-12 hours of full use (around a week of on and off usage). I would definitely buy it again at the same price.
134,Great tablet for kids. Would be better if it had a bit more storage as system apps take up most of the storage on the tablet. Battery could be better but aside from that I am happy with my purchase. Easy to navigate and my 5yo can use it with ease.
135,"I really enjoy using this tablet, it is heavier than my previous one which was a 9.6"" screen but it feels more solid and I have been less prone to dropping it. I prefer the size of the 9.6 as this one is longer but it does the job well."
136,Well it's lasted ok for 6 months which is better than some dreadful shoddy phones I've bought. Mostly pretty good value for money but definitely slower working than Samsung phone. Not much storage for apps really though and the camera could be better.Holds it's charge reasonably well.Pretty good.
137,Received one as a reward for switching my energy to Amaysim. Retail price is $235 normally. Had it for a few days now.
138,Pros:# From a reputable brand so you know you're getting quality product/software/suppport# Size is between a phone and a tab# User friendly OS (Android Lollipop) and interface (Samsung)# Good battery life and many easy-to-get accessories on the market# Reasonably priced
139,"Con:# The 8G internal memory is not enough, definitely need the SD card# It gets a little slow if you have a few apps open and the touchscreen does not feel as responsive as the high end android devices or iOS.# For a little more money you can get much better devices."
140,"If you want a budget tablet to fiddle around at home, reading ebooks surfing the net or playing some games, it sure is a winner provided you get the one with most internal memory."
141,"This tablet allowed for phone and data functionality which proved to be beneficial, if this device was just to be used for its data connection, in a pinch you change over the sim card it becomes a fully functional phone also.  I do believe that 16gb is too small of internal storage however a micro SD card can upgrade it's capacity."
142,"This tablet served as my online ""everything"" while I was travelling. I did my emails, my banking, booked emergency hotel rooms, skyped home and watched movies on it. It served me perfectly and has been charged in several different countries and all over Australia with zero problems. - that's impressive! I don't even keep it in a case, just a felt sleeve. The screen was so much nicer than the others when i bought it that the decision was easy and it has certainly panned out!"
143,Good entry level tablet. Has enough speed and memory to start out. Not a great amount of memory but has enough for someone just starting to use this type of technology. I would recommend getting one with more memory for teens etc. I believe that the low price is due to this factor.
144,"i bought this second hand but was in new condition and every thing was great , after 6 months when i plugged the charger in i looked at it hours later and it wasnt charging , i googled it and the device wasnt recognising the charger as a samsung charger (even though it is the chrger that came with the tablet and had been working up until that point) so it was charging incredibly slowly. the tablet and cord are undamaged... but it makes it pretty unusable if it takes so long to charge since you chew through the battery in a few hours if you play games such as candy crush on it"
145,I recently purchased a samsung tab A 10.1 after having an apple. The samsung is a better product by far. And its magnetic. ie u can attach it to ur fridge or something metal.  I called samsung and they weren't aware of this feature. Not complaining. Its quite a handy feature.
146,"This tablet was cheaper than the others, and I decided to buy it. This tablet does all the basics you need to do, like emailing someone, watching YouTube. All that simple stuff. I do recommend to get this if you are looking for something affordable. I bought this from JB hi fi."
147,"Perfect size, thin, lighweight, long battery life lasts over 10 hours for us with continuous use , which is incresoble Bought for my children.  Amazing quality tempted to buy another for myself . Flawless design durable screen, camera isnt too bad .absolutely love them, cant fault them at all. Love love love!"
148,"I purchased his tablet a few months  ago and I use it for everything, I use it for writing up school reports, for online banking, internet, just everything and I wouldn’t ever buy anything else. It has so many different types of features and it can be used for so many things"
149,I love this tablet because i can do anything with it. It helps me in my day to day life. I love the size of the screen. I take it everywhere I go.I would recommend it whole heartily as it is a very good tablet. My whole family love it too.
150,"I love this so much , it’s so handy  for my daughter , the stylus is so smooth it  and everything IS so smooth and sharp display ,  I love how easy it is to use , and use it like my own personal laptop but portable would highly recommend this product to anyone"
151,The product is great. I bought 3 for family members but one was a lemon.  The customer service is a killer. I refuse to buy any more Samsung products as a result. The other 2 are awesome. The apps are so easy to use and download. There are Samsung apps as well for daily things.
152,"I use the tablet for many different reasons. To keep up to date with email, reading the news on digital newspaper, games and importantly for storing all our sheet music. We can play a tune anywhere now with 100's of songs, lyrics and chords carried with us whilst travelling. I connect to the mobile phone as modem so have internet with us always is fine i recommend it ."
153,"Quite a good tablet for the price.Can be a little slow at time but nothing to worrying, Runs pretty much any game you install .Good response on the screen sensitivity I would recommend this for anyone who can't afford a brand new one. And the accessories are quite cheap aswell."
154,"I use the tablet for many different reasons. To keep up to date with email, reading the news on digital newspaper, games and importantly for storing all our sheet music. We can play a tune anywhere now with 100's of songs, lyrics and chords carried with us whilst travelling. I connect to the mobile phone as modem so have internet with us always."
155,"The speakers on the Galaxy Tab A devices get reasonably loud, and sound pretty good overall. These tablets also bring with them quite a few incentives on the software side, including the availability of six Microsoft applications pre-installed, along with the option to claim 100 GB of free cloud storage for 2 years with the use of Microsoft OneDrive.  The great battery life is a great feature, however the low resolution displays and slower performance make it hard to justify the high price points when compared to the competition."
156,I prefer glab A on iPad as of easy software .lite weight . 4G extendable internal memory with sd card up to 256 gig. RAM is 2gig which not that bad for tablet . You can do all basic things with Galaxy tab A good for kids studies and home work.
157,"Bought this tablet for my 4 year old to play games on and watch TV at quiet time. It appears to be working great at the moment, easy user interface. Fairly simple set up. Was able to install both Stan and Netflix onto it, which is a big plus for me."
158,"Its great. Fantastic use for my daughter who loves to watch you tube kids tvIts battery life is good and easy to navigate.however do be careful when installing other programs though. For instance I accidentally installed a program and advertisements kept popping up afterwards constantly. However, a factory reset will get rid of that problem"
159,Like most Samsung products this tablet is super easy to use and comes with a great range of useful apps. Amazing clear picture and sound. Unfortunately though the front and back cameras are similar to those found on an old nokia flip phone. In short absolutely perfect for Netflix and Youtube... not ideal for Skyping with family and friends.
160,"We use this mostly when we go away. It is absolutely fantastic.We can do everything that we need just from the one device. All banking, bookings research and email AND watch movies in the plane on the way up. The screen is lovely and a good enough size to see properly. Battery life is great and because it is Samsung we know the quality is good."
161,Good little tablet but after a few months it started freezing and glitching alot and when we tried to claim it on warranty they wouldn't accept it as there was a crack in the screen. Either way handy little tablet but didnt have much space and didn't even last a year.
162,"I have previously owned a Nexus 7 32 Gigabyte tablet, so this had a lot to live up to.   It beats it mostly, but the Nexus 7 is stil special to me.  A family member got this free with a 4G wireless data deal with Telstra.  Great value then!"
163,"Pros+ more RAM (2Gb), good multitasking and gaming, a faster processor than I'm used to,+ great battery life.  Can last a whole day even with hours of video watching+ it's thin and pleasant to hold in your hand+ nice sized screen, do think the bezel around it could be smaller though.+ good wifi and bluetooth connectivity, including 5G Wireless AC, gets good reception all through our house (unlike the Nexus 7 which dropped out sometimes, and wasn't AC compatible, just 5G Wireless N and had bluetooth connectivity issues too)+ very bright screen with ok colours (a bit washed out compared to the Nexus though).+ Like the size of the screen, 8 inches beats 7 for watching videos+ can add an SD card to add space and a 4G sim card for data on the go, which is fantastic"
164,"Cons- Dislike how the buttons don't light up if you're in the dark, making it difficult to find them.  After months of use, I still think the multi-tab button logically should be on the right and the back button on the left, like it is on my Nexus 7!- Camera is slow to focus and I don't use it for that reason- Hate the location of the control buttons.  They're too close to the edge, while using in landscape mode, I often accidentally tap them.  Very frustrating, often ruining the immersion in a relaxing time and losing whatever you were watching or reading!  (I prefer the Nexus 7 where they are built into the screen).- Low resolution is definitely noticeable when browsing and reading.  It can seem like looking through a fine flyscreen if I zoom right in with my reading glasses on!"
165,"I have no problem running Netflix  & stan, emails , online shopping and reading on this tablet and it does the job better than a mobile phone as watching shows on the biggest screen possible is always better. Its fast enough and I was happy with the price especially with it being Samsung.."
166,"A friend had an old Samsung 7.0"" tablet that she liked.  She wanted to upgrade.  We checked around (note: check the product codes for different shops; they are selling 7.0"" tablets for Samsung but they neglect to mention which year and model) and bought from JB Hi-Fi."
167,My friend loves it.  Feels great and she knows she can rely on it for class.  She's been using it happily for months now.  We even found it will take a sim card and make phone calls etc which is something that wasn't promoted on the website. :D
168,Highly recommended
169,"I recently purchased this product as an alternative to reading books. Unlike Kindle, it allows me to ready any pdf book or file I download from the internet.I won't recommend it for playing games as I did not find it a very powerful machine. The screen resolution is good enough for reading books. The stylus is very responsive, however, you will feel some lag. Galaxy Note 8 pen won't work on it, perhaps it uses an older technology. I've fitted it with a 256 GB Samsung memory card that allows me to download videos on it. The battery is huge, and if you enable battery saver, it goes for almost 4 days (moderate usage).Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product."
170,"Great for reading , Netflix , emails , soooooo much better than a big mobile phone , I use mine when I travel for work , on the bus or the train ,  waiting at the doctors surgery , I pop it my hand bag and pop in my ear phones wherever I am!"
171,"Light good looking mid size tablet.  Fast data transfer, micro sd card slot if uou need to move stuff around.  I use this as i travel a lot and cant use my government computer for personal use.  Lives up to samsung reliability promises for me for basic internet use and keeping up on social media.  Love the pic quality too, good for landscape use"
172,"Big enough, fast enoungh, enough ram, more than enough batterylife.  I have been using this tablet for my daily browsing and viewing for a couple of months now. Runs very quickly and smoothly."
173,"If i needed to find it's worse point, it would be a stretch, it would be its wifi range.  It just doesn't have the same range as my Samsung mobile phone."
174,Other than that I cannot fault it.
175,"Great tablet,got extra 3 ur warranty, just in case.got loads of memory. Takes great picture,got all features that I need.I was impressed with my service, staff were very helpful. I am scared of been hacked,as has happened before to me, so hopefully I can get good security apps so doesn't appen again"
176,"Had this tablet for more than two years and has given good trouble free service.It has a really great bright screen and takes great pictures, Have put in 32 gig sd card  to expand storage capacity and the 64 gig memory that is standard easily handles all the things I use it for.The battery life is not great but can be increased easily by turning down screen brightness.It is also very light and slim -it  travels easily."
177,"I have this tablet for almost a few months now, I really love it, really comes handy very light to be carried in your shoulder bag, the camera works really good, takes good quality photos, I am just a  little bit concern with the charging part of it, it gets flat way sooner than what I expect.Pricewise is really reasonable and affordable."
178,"I bought this at about February and this is really useful for me to go to class as i can jot down notes simply by the “pen” which is much faster than joting down notes through your laptopAnd i really like how it looks, it looks simple!!And this is also easy to use"
179,"Got this for my son  he fulled it with apps in no time. Got the expanded sd card in it but some of the pre loaded apps can't be moved. Constantly asks to free up space. Camera is also a bit pathetic. On the plus side, it was really cheap for a samsung and he finds it easy to use as it is the same as my phone."
180,"I use this Tab A for work and it's GREAT! It's small enough that traveling with it isn't a hassle, we use it for spotify, trip advisor, calling, texting, google maps and more!! Don't use the pen and finding a decent case that fits properly is a pain. Also the charger"
181,I use this Tab for travel/work and it gets the job done for me! It's small enough that traveling with it isn't a hassle. I have my portfolio loaded onto it so I can bring it to interviews with me and showcase my work without bringing a clunky laptop. The only downside is it's camera quality is pretty bad but I never use the camera on it so that didn't bother me.
182,I use it to download books and read them in bed. As it is so light perfect for reading in bed. Nice size for playing games on. Nice picture quality and good settings enable how bright it is. Like it better than the other brand I have just due to its size and weight.
183,"I have my computer, my phone, my work computer, my laptop and when I need it the tablet is there for me to fill in any spaces that I need. It is easy for on the go, with 4G I can watch Netflix when I am out, distract the kids in the car without losing my phone. BIG WIN!"
184,"I just bought a new Samsung tablet and it's not working, fuzzy picture,you can't reset it because you can't see the icons and it's all in chinese,waiting for seller to get a refund or a new tablet.I own 2 Samsung tablets and I had never had any problems,that's why I upgraded to a new one"
185,"Got mine via Telstra and have never looked back. First tablet ever tried and loved how easy it was to use...however, I just don't like the automatic updates you can't really turn off. Once you update, you can't go back unless you do a complete factory reset and lose all your photos and apps in the process. Compact and light weight, I recommended this product. Holds charge well and can play movies all night long without needing a recharge. This baby wins my vote by its flexibility with an SD card for extra storage. Screen is a decent size for web browsing, watching a movie on your own, and the camera is easy enough to operate. My child loves that it is child friendly in its simplistic usability."
186,"I was not computer literate, but my sister encouraged me to start using a tablet. I resisted her invitation, until she took me shopping and we got a tablet. Now I use it so much and it relaxes me! I need to learn more about my gadget, but I am happy as I am!"
187,"I absolutely love this tablet. I had an IPad before this and decided to try the Tab A after reading reviews. So glad I did. It is easy to use  with a decent size screen. The only annoying thing is the position of the Home button, and the Back and Overview buttons which are printed on the front. While this means they are readily available without taking up valuable screen space, the Back button is positioned where it’s very easy to accidentally touch."
188,"Great Tablet and well priced. Has a hood selection of apps and accessories and is a better  option than more expensive modules due to how fast electronics go out of date. The battery life is good, camera is good quality and processing speed is adequate. The option to use external memory card is great and is some competitiors downside."
189,"I bought this to travel and I think it is marvelous. I have been using for emails and Facebook but the best thing is movies on the go. I have it set up with Netflix and its just great.I chose Samsung because of the good reputation and you can tell the quality of the design is very high. Battery life is excellent, screen sharpness is excellent and I can use it for days without a recharge.I am very pleased with this machine and I wish I had bought one years ago."
190,"Bought this for a bit of work, play and everything in between!"
191,"Screen great, does suffer badly from glare and finger prints; did apply a glass screen protector and has gotten better!"
192,"The battery good life is what I'd call highly acceptable for the amount I use it, I do keep te memory clered and use the Samsung clean tool often and recharge at about 50 / 60%  to aid the batteries longevity. The charger is ample in charging the battery, the supplied cable has deteriorated to a manky yellow colour and stiffened up... Tried a aftermarket 3m USB cable, but the tablet didnt charge all too well for some reason??"
193,"Wished it came in black though, had to apply a chinesium cover to hide the whiteness overall - being used for work did see me pick it up with greasy hands so the case was a necessity!"
194,"Overall I really do love this tablet, stpre it in a Case Logic mini laptop case with all its bits in the front pocket and its very convenient to carry while travelling or going places - or to avoid boredom!"
195,"Great tablet, easy to use Android.  I have had a few different brands of tablet but the Samsung is the best yet. Fast, easy to use, even a beginner could get this in a short time. Really highly recommend this brand! You really can't go wrong with a Samsung, their after sales service is also great."
196,"June 5th 2018 Update: Excellent Tablet, all you'll ever need!"
197,"This is an excellent android tablet. It is so easy to use and a lot of fun. It is also a great little work tablet. Plenty of storage space and a good size 10.1"" screen. I have had other tablets but would only buy Samsung in future. It really is the best tablet I have ever had."
198,"Not a bad product, better for the kids rather than adults unless you don't mind slower/delayed connection. The camera and video quality are not as good in comparison to say an Apple Ipad (which we have upgraded too) However, the kids don't mind and enjoy playing games and watching you tube."
199,"It a good tablet only 16gb and it nearly full , I'm not that good on the tablet but I  do know that you put up photos on it , there is 3 different places on the tablet it goes to and if you wipe one photo off , you lose it all together . Great for playing card games and FB but over all it does needto be bigger in the gb department instead os 16 , it should be the next one up higher what ever that is.."
200,Great little tablet for on the go. Lightweight and easy to use. Pixel resolution is amazing. Very clear and bright.The only fault I say is that it runs hot sometimes and can lag every so often.This is the 3rd tablet I have brought from Samsung and would gladly purchase another Samsung product in the near future
201,I love my tablet does all the things that I need it to do and doesn't waste my time on things I don't need. While it's not the biggest or the fastest model tablet out there it is perfect for browsing the web or Facebook and emails and playing games
202,"The Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (introduced in 2016) is a good value tablet. It's not particularly impressive in terms of speed -- with only a 1.5ghz Exynos 7870 Octa processor and 2GB of RAM, it'll browse the web fine, playback HD movies and such, but because of it's anemic graphics processing hardware, don't expect to be playing the most recent mobile games such as PUBG or Fortnite on this device."
203,"This Galaxy tab definitely feels dated as it only runs Nougat and the chances of seeing an Oreo update is very unlikely, so don't buy this one if you're expecting some attention from Samsung developers. It is well and truly, a device that's on the brink of obsolescence. Only buy it if you see it go under $260 dollars."
204,I don't know much about technology but it was recommended that I purchase this tablet. It was a steep learning curve but I'm glad that I spent the money on a quality product. Not many tech sites agree on anything but most people seem happy with this device. It has been easy to use and faultless.
205,I've really enjoyed owning this tablet all these years. Only now is it beginning to show signs of slowing down due to being forgotten about by software updates and the like. I would still recommend this tablet if you can find it brand new. It would be perfect for school kids or students wanting an easy wifi enables tablet to do research and study on the move. Super useful in car rides too!
206,"I purchased this product back in 2016. It was on sale from JBHIFI. It's functional and useful for university. However the camera is terrible. Photos taken are blurry. So if anyone wants a tab to take photos, I would not recommend this device. On the other hand, for work and/or study related purposes, I suggest this device as it has everything"
207,"We have this for my daughter and it is very fast and reliable. Its thin and sleek, not heavy at all and the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. We only use wifi on it but for trips in the car we download some apps that dont require wifi."
208,"I received this tablet as a bonus product when getting the Note 8. It is thinner than my other Samsung tablet so is handy for travelling. It is easy to use and hasnt had any glitches like my old one, mainly randomly turning itself off. It does everything i want and is handy when i need a bigger screen than the Note8."
209,"Bought this tab not long ago and probably was one of the best decisions I’ve made! It’s very handy and I love the way it works, the battery lasts for a very long time as well. It has a very sleek and modern appearance, which i love. Very impressed, never buying Apple again."
210,I really  love this product and  use it almost everyday. The size  and the speed are so right for me to do what i need to do . I have not found any flaw so far. I would recommend  every one of my friend to purchase it for everyday use.
211,Very convenient. Simple to use. Android is so easy. Same familiar apps that you use on your mobile. Reasonably fast processor. Great for movie making and slide shows. Best is being able to use in screen mirroring mode with our smart TV.  Can watch streaming movies through the TV or simply use the TV as a large monitor for your work. Great simple tablet for a bargain price match from JB HiFi.
212,"It is not good too slow and can't use like a phone ( game, video, messenger, etc. ) but this product very very cheapand the chipeast model of Samsung Galaxy Tab series so i'm satisfied aspect of price and cost - effectiveness. i would like to recommend this for child ( edu. )"
213,Easy to use. Good product. Only flaw so far is after warranty the screen got a line through it not a crack. Apart from that its got heaps of free apps to choose from. It seems to manage most games well. Updates to software so far have not caused any unwanted issues. So overall happy with product.
214,"I love this tablet. Upgraded from the samsung 8"". Connects easily and quickly to wifi. Havent had any issues at all. Plenty of space to download apps etc. Camera is quite clear as well. Sound is good. Would recommend to anyone looking for an android tablet. Was under the $500 mark."
215,"The tablet is easy to use surprised since I’ve ised apple products all my life, the size of the tablet is great, it’s not to big and not to small so you can still watch movies or shows comfortably. I find tablets are easy to use as they are very straight forward."
