0,"This is ok, and its sold out as usual, if u see it in store grab it or you be missing out on it. The quality is good for being wireless, Look no further since its a apple product. Buy it as soon u see it in store today. buy it, cause they are rare to find and so popular why not join the crowd."
1,"The convenience factor of not having wires are amazing. I personally am not a huge fan of in-ear headphones, so no other headphones fit me as well as these ones. Sound quality is great, battery life is great with the case, and they are super easy to use. Solid purchase."
2,"Got tired of untangling headphones so jumped into a new set of gen2 AirPods. Had for about a week now and overall I like them. I run and have been able to use them for this (they don’t fall out), and for phone calls they seem good."
3,"Only a few gripes... when I am on the phone and near my PC, the devices fight for connection which means my caller cannot hear me (and I can’t hear them) - would be nice if this could be fixed..."
4,"I’ve had a few drop outs on calls when away from my desk, but perhaps this is user error."
5,"These are the most convenient headphones I have ever used, although they have a high price I think it is worth it because of how easy they pair compared to other Bluetooth headphones. Sound quality is fine but what you are buying is for the easy pairing"
6,"I listen to everything on the airpods. From rave music to basic pop music, the airpods just make them sounds all pretty neat."
7,The airpods are made for physical activities so that you won't have a cord dangling around your found while doing these activities. Life saver.
8,"Extremely satisfied with the sound volume, Max volume doesn't blow out my eardrums."
9,"The wireless range lasts as far as it needs to be. If you have a airpods, your phone is bound to be nearby hence doing its job."
10,"Easy to use, just turn on and connect via Bluetooth for the first time. After that, automatically connects when detects your phone. Great sound quality and microphone picks up voice very clearly. Battery life lasts days so scarcely charge the headphones."
11,I have purchased and tried tons of wireless earphones but no one can be compared to my airpods. Perfect connection with the iphone and no lag has been experienced since the first day. The only drawback might be the overpricing but still acceptable.
12,"They're not perfect, they sometimes requires some resetting and are frustrating but overall I think I got my $229 value after heavy continual use since December 2016 (got them day of release)."
13,"Alas, after almost 2.5 years they have died. I'll be buying another pair and hoping the bluetooth connection is a little better."
14,Would not fit so kept falling out with minor movement. Could not get a refund either from Apple store as they would not accept it as a valid return reason
15,"I first worried the AirPods would be so easy to fall out, but it is not quite actually. I love how easy it can be use and you no longer need to get control by an electric wire. Heard of a news saying using the AirPods would get cancer, so would not recommend people buying it now."
16,"I usually use these to listen to music on my phone or laptop and they are so handy and easy to use as they connect easily via bluetooth. I often walk with these and have had no problems and as they are wireless and do not have a cord, they never get tangled up like my other earphones. I am very happy with the volume and sound quality of these and it is so handy that you can see the battery life of each airpod and also the case. The battery life is fairly long, around 4-5 hours of listening time before they need to be charged again. I haven't had any problems with the wireless range of the headphones and they never seem to disconnect if I do go into the next room."
17,"I listen to mostly songs with heavy bass and i gotta say it’s really good almost better than i expected. however these earbuds are not suitable for running depending on the shape of year you have but if you are just chilling, these feel like they aren’t even in your ears. the sound is really good too with very little to almost no lag when watching youtube."
18,I use then for listing to youtube videos them. i use them at the gym they are fantastic and i love the range on them and the fact they don't have the cord
19,"I recently got these headphone for my birthday and I am very happy and pleased with them! They come in light and compact casing and are very easy to use. They also stay paired with your phone, they don't continually disconnect. I find the audio quality to be fairly good and the wireless range allows me to walk in the next room and still be connected. My only issue would be to be careful if you want them for exercise as they can sometimes come a bit loose in the ear and sometimes need to be readjusted to avoid slipping."
20,"I listen to EVERYTHING on my AirPods. I never take them out at home or at the gym. and highly recommend for those who love to jog, walk the dog, exercise etc."
21,I have been using the first gen AirPods for over two years and upgraded. They are even better. Ability to use Siri without touching anything is just awesome.
22,"People regularly ask if they fall out. In over two years, they have fell out once (because I didn’t have them in properly)."
23,I have bought many headsets. The AirPods are the only ones I would recommend with no hesitation.
24,"Only concern is battery life, previous ones were running at 1/2 battery life after 1.5 years. Considering they were used daily, it’s no drama, but a slight annoyance."
25,"I got given these for Christmas and I love them. At the gym they are fantastic and so much easier without the cord. They are so helpful driving also because you can double tap the side of them and use siri. “Hey Siri, send a text message” etc while driving."
26,"My Apple Airpods are the best purchase i have ever made. Will never go back to cord earphones again. They are so easy to connect and use, the charging case is amazing and the battery life lasts me a week plus!"
27,These earphones are extremely good but cost a lot of money. You can expect that i guess but i don't want to empty my wallet like i did. I would recommend buying if you have the budget. Sound quality is great and the battery life is absolutely amazing.
28,"Really good set of ear buds, can hear very clear while talking on the phone and they have a good range, have never fallen out during physical activity or exercise"
29,"When these first came out I decided against buying them thinking they would easily fall out of my ears or be easy to lose. After buying a cheaper different brand which stopped working after a few months I decided to give them a go and I’m so glad I did. They are comfortable to wear, haven’t fallen out and the sound quality is good. Can highly recommend :-)"
30,"These are really amazing to use for the first week, the novelty does wear off after this however. Whist they are practical, they are easy to fall out of my ears. I have lost one for a few days before. It was in the couch so be careful and make sure they fit your ears right. I wanted to go running with them but im worried now."
31,"I would definitely recommend this product. Great quality, great sound ! Can watch from distance and do something Else at the same time. They are so comfy, never fell out of your ears. Fantastic!"
32,these work so well! great for when you dont want to be stuck to your device. can watch from far away and get other things done while using them. they connect so quick and last for as long as needed! the case is probably one of the best inventions! quick charging too!
33,"I seriously don’t know how I could live without,, as a mum with 4 kids,, if I’m on a call and have head phones and one of the kids starts having a mental breakdown I need to be able to still be on the call and assist my child and their issues,,, I would defiantly recommend this product !!"
34,This head phones are really good for when your always gonna walking around so u don’t have those wireless earphones dangling from your body I think the volume is pretty good and perfect for he ears mostly with the headphones music
35,"range is very good, easily 15-20 metres. the sound quality is awesome. if they blocked out more outside sound they would be perfect but for the first generation theyre awesome. love that you can choose to use one at a time or both if you want. only issues are the price, theyre quite pricey, and they can come loose in your ears, especially during exercise"
36,"I love these so much! The battery lasts so long, they sound great and are super portable."
37,I listen to music on the way to work and they have never let me down!
38,Please buy! You won't regret it!
39,Not a long term item for me: I used them for commuting and they do not block out ambient sound. This means that the volume needs to be turned way up.
40,"I listen to music, youtube, and make calls with the Airpods.Personally, I do not use the Airpods for exercising as I get sweaty and it will slip out, I can use them when I'm cleaning however.The sound volume is great on the Airpods and they are not noise cancelling which makes it more safer for users when they are in public such as commuting to uni or work.The wireless range of the Airpods are solid and better than most decent bluetooth earbuds."
41,"Airpods are great. Seriously i thought they were a waste of money when they came out but they're some of the best cordless wireless earbuds on the market. The design is ehhh but other then that i love them, case is really nice, they connect so fast, and sound quality is fantastic. The two touch on the earbud feature is really nice and can be customized"
42,"AirPods are gold!! You won’t regret the $$ spent to purchase. I bought a pair, lost them 18 months later and then couldn’t stand not having them so I bought again... That really says it all! The sound is so superior to wired earbuds and the knock offs. Siri is a fabulous feature just tap and ask. Love, love, love them! ❤️"
43,"Simply put if it was not for the HiFi performance (or lack of) these would get five stars. I am completely satisfied in every other way. I can hear callers clearly and they often comment on how clear I am. They have good range and last through a busy day thanks to the fact they charge when placed in the pod. I, unfortunately, lost one but you can buy a replacement from Apple for only $65 (AUD) the downside is you need to book a service call or wait about 30 mins in an Apple shop before you can actually buy one. More essential than a watch as I miss these immediately if I walk out the door without them. I also use just one in my ear in preference to car Bluetooth / speakers as it is so much easier and clearer for both parties."
44,"These little guys work perfectly! Although at first they looked nerdy they sure look better than the buds that Bose came out with. Unlike Bose they are the perfect size for my ears, they don't fall out easily and are great for running. Easy to connect, battery last forever— i rarely have to charge them."
45,Certainly worth the price if you dont lose them!
46,"Really loved it. The battery lasted more than expected, and the case provides a quick charge once it needs. It works flawless with the iPhone. I saw comments said they are not comfortable for long time use, which I find they are pretty comfortable to me. The only thing I would ask more is for it to be noise cancelling in the future pods. Other than that, it's perfect."
47,"Apple air pods have literally changed my life, I was extremely skeptical at first because i needed something that i could wear on my way to work, use handsfree to talk AND at the gym running on a treadmill so i was very worried one would fall out but they stay in the ears so easily i never worry about this happening anymore. The wireless connection between my iphone and the airpods is incredible, plus the case actually charges them which is so handy especially when im out and about. Highly recommend these to anybody needing new headphones."
48,"Got the airpods as christmas present,  after 3 weeks of use, I find them uncomfortable to use for long periods of time as the material is hard same as a normal iphone earphones.  They tend to fall if you move around, maybe they tought people will sit still but if you are on the move like walking forget it , I need to keep pushing them into the ear. If you bend to pick something bend again th pick earpod again. Sound is nothing great, maybe for a phone call but nothing for like a train ride listening to music as has zero noise cancelling. I am sorry 229 AUD got wasted on this, if I could I would return and get money in something else.  Battery seems to last but as uncomfortable I have not lasted more than 1 hr with them on ear to test 5hr battery."
49,"Love them!! I got them for my 11 year old son a couple years ago. Not only do they have excellent sound, they went through a full washer cycle and dryer cycle and still sound as good as the day I got them. Very durable! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for earphones, your search stops here."
50,I have had my AirPods for over a year now and haven't had a day go by when I haven't used them. Thanks to their small form factor and great batteryI always carry these in my pocket throughout the day. I currently have a red silicone cover on the AirPods case to protect it from scratches & marks which I grabbed off eBay for only a few dollars - I can greatly recommend these to anyone looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds
51,I use these at the gym. Get Spotify going and leave my phone in my gym bag and I get range throughout the whole gym. No more cords to deal with or carrying my phone around with me whilst I work out working the most comfortable place the have it. These air pods are a purchase I certainly do not regret
52,"I often looked at the air pods, but thinking of previous iPhone OEM headphones I was turned off, purely from a comfort point of view. I needed some new headphones, so I thought I would give them a go, worst come to worst I could return them. Well, looking from the outside they looked certain to fall out at every bump, but nothing further from the truth. The pods fit really nicely, are very comfortable and secure once in ear. The charging is easy, the battery life great, and as you would expect the sound is pretty good. A clever storage/charge case makes the pods perfect."
53,"AirPods are a great idea, they have excellent sound quality and some pretty cool features. They come in a nifty chargeable case which automatically connects to your selected Bluetooth upon opening. However, in my opinion they need a new design. After using the AirPods for a few hours they become unbearably uncomfortable.. You cannot change the volume on the headphones or skip songs if you are listening to music away from your selected device. All in all they are a great product but more consideration for design should have been taken considering the ridiculous price tag."
54,"I love these cordless AirPods, at the start I didn’t like that They didn’t have a volume control like the original apple earphones but I now control the volume with an Apple Watch. Sound quality is really good. They are very durable, I accidentally dropped one in water and it still worked. Batteries last ages."
55,"I Love these!! Awesome sound and they fit perfectly in my ears! I can run, jog with no worries of losing them! The range is pretty is pretty awesome! I would recommend to anyone! Regardless if your active or not! Has few other cool features. I have a pair and just bought my husband a pair."
56,I am very happy my apple AirPods especially when i work out i don't need to use my phone i just connect it to my Apple Iwatch and you don't need to carry your phone with you while you do you everyday routine at home or when you do work out.
57,"I've been avoiding air pods for awhile given the price point. Finally decided to splurge and these have been amazing. Love the convenience, tech, build and sound quality. If you're considering it, take the plunge. The fit well and have had no issues with them during runs or at the gym."
58,"Waste of money . They don’t work outside , only inside.   Bought to use with a Garmin watch but sound is terrible , paired to my iPhone and sound is the same when outside .  because it’s outside of apples 14 days you will get no refund . No customer service .    Do yourself a favour and buy another from anyone other than Apple ."
59,"Surprisingly, the airpods are great at staying, even when I'm exercising. Connecting to the phone is easy, sound quality is decent, but would be a hassle if you lost one. Luckily Apple replaces the individual airpods for a smaller fee. One issue is cleaning the inside is quite difficult. Earbuds are useful here."
60,"The ability to type, talk and walk is amazing. The wireless range covers a large area and is very clear, they bring new meaning to hands free! The Apple AirPods have made working more efficient and compliment working remotely really well indoors and outdoors in all types of conditions. Brilliant!"
61,Absolutely in love with this amazing device. Great sound quality even though it doesn’t have noise cancelling option and highly flexible due its wireless feature. It covers quite a decent amount of distance. The auto stop facility is very helpful. The case charges the AirPods within a few minutes. Overall a satisfied customer.
62,I’m happy with my AirPods for the functionality. I do think there areMuch better headphones out there for sound quality but the battery on the AirPods is great and they do recharge fairly quickly.
63,"I only purchased these as I had a credit at Apple, I otherwise wouldn’t have paid what they were asking for them."
64,"Exactly like the original apple headphones however completely wireless, I haven’t tested the distance for what the headphones cover I use these when working/studying and leave my phone and walk around and the music flows freely the only problem is I haven’t figured out controls like volume ect without adjusting manually on my phone."
65,"I was skeptical at first but I am a firm believer of the passion, heart and soul that goes into the products. I went to the store and absolutely stunned with this product. I am a life long avid hater of wired headphones as they just don't stick to my ears and it's annoying when the wires come off as I move about. The sound quality of these are astonishing and they look very Apple-ish. A beautiful product. Charges quickly and no interference at all. I noticed the sound stops if I'm walking close to the tram lines but that's not a big issue. Overall A+ product with a superb sound quality and above all, one of the best truly wireless product. I'm never going back to conventional headphones again."
66,"Very happy with these - nifty little devices that somehow stay in the ear, and produce s high quality sound. It somehow knew my name when connecting to both my phone and iPad and only needed Bluetooth to be on. Love the little charging box which looks like a pack of dental floss. A little pricey, but Apple provide good after-sales service so if they are nurtured, I expect them to last a good long time."
67,"The Apple AirPods has really great sound quality and are very comfortable to wear. It is easy to use and easy to connect and I love the function when it auto-stop and replay when you take off. The battery life is long but you still need to charge it everyday.If you use an iPhone, and you need a pair of cable-free bluetooth earphones, AirPods is the best option! And I am now so regret why didn't I buy this earlier."
68,"In the case of barrier-free access, the link range is about 40 meters. The battery life is good, the ultimate use time of about 5 hours is relatively durable, and the fast charge function is perfect. The user experience is great and the links between the devices are very smooth."
69,Bought these headphones a few months ago and the sound quality is pretty decent for the price. They sync up to my iPhone nicely. Sometimes the Bluetooth signal gets disconnnected randomly but will reconnect within a few seconds. Build quality is nice and sound quality would be a 8/10. Would recommend!
70,"I needed some wireless headphones, mainly for telephone calls, so i can be hands free.these proved to be so good!"
71,"connecting via bluetooth is so quick and simple and it picks up my desktop computer, iPad and iPhone so easily.they charge easily, are compact and lightweight and easily and comfortably fit in the ear.also the sound quality when listening to music is excellent."
72,Love them!
73,"If you use your phone a lot, particularly for business, these earphones free you from your phone and free up your hands.The earphones work perfectly. Sound is way better than expected, you can speak naturally and the listener can always hear without any complaint ever, the speaker also has effective noise cancelling elements so the listener again has little annoyance when listening to your voice.The pods always pair perfectly with the iphone and there is simply no issue.The carry case acts as a charger so you have charge in both the pods as well as reserve charge in the carry case.The carry case is very elegant.Worth every cent!The ability to not have to carry your phone as you move around the office was not something I realised would be such a usefully tool!!"
74,"I bought it to my wife. They connect quickly and easily and have great sound quality. They are unobtrusive, comfortable and stay in place. The clarity when talking on your phone is excellent for both parties. They hold their charge well and I love that you get the battery life notification for both the AirPods and the case every time you connect."
75,"Great wireless range, can move around the house inside and outside with phone in the one spot."
76,Also great for connecting to Apple Watch and Mac with no connectivity issues at all.
77,The AirPods are quick to charge and fit perfectly in both ears. Haven’t fallen out during vigorous exercises
78,I use them every day The freedom that you have to move around without headphone cords is amazing. They connect instantly with my phone and are perfect for the gym and for hiding them under your hair. Double tap feature to receive the call is awesome. It has really great sound quality and are very comfortable to wear. Would recommend this to everyone!
79,"than wired headphones wearing comfortable, quite good, usually not accustomed to use Bluetooth headset, but this I will like, easy to carry, Bluetooth connection is very fast, Apple's workmanship is trustworthy, rather than it is a pair of headphones, it is a piece of art! The sound quality is impeccable in this in-ear headset, which is better than the quality of the line control that comes with a handy machine!"
80,apple airpods are just flawless. switched to Jam bluetooth headset and pairing them is such a pai. Sold my airpods to get airpods 2 and i miss mine so much. no other headsets comes close.Only thing that lacks is the bass but i can live with that.Just check it does not fall of your ears
81,The wireless range of these headphones is great. The sound quality is excellent. And it makes speaking on the phone especially paper that had trouble hearing you before a breeze. I love these  headphones. Can’t live without them.  I must admit it took me a bit of fiddling to get them in the right position originally .
82,"Very satisfied with the range.The sensors are amazing, you can be listening to something on your phone via phone speakers, pop the AirPod in your ear and it automatically changes to the AirPod. My only criticism is I hate having to remember to charge them but other then that the ability to use the find my iPhone function on them is awesome"
83,I love the airpods. They come in a fantastic charging box which is functional and stylish. The airpods fit perfectly in my ears with great sound. They are just so easy to carry around and put away. I am really glad I made this purchase and would highly recommend it to everyone.
84,I love the Apple AirPods they are very practical especially if you are a very active person or like doing multiple things whilst listening to music with headphones. I found that my set at the tip of the bud that sits in your ear came undone. It literally spilt from the rest of the headphone and left all the little cords dangling out. I had to try and push the cords back in and squeez them back together so it prevents it from happening again
85,Bad.  Mo options for smaller ears... they keep falling out and no returns on them for hygenic reasons which i understand but i wasnt able to try them first for the same reason.  Seems like i need to be able to try something to ensure its a fit first at least.
86,"Work, sports and entertainment, easy to use, long battery life, stable connection, the focus is to wear comfortably for a long time.Due to work reasons, I took 2 hours to call every day. AirPods liberated my hands very well, improved my work efficiency, patted Siri twice, then said ""call XX"", the call ended, and the second was changed back to the music. When you just bring your headphones, you will hear a very soft “gudong” sound."
87,"The sound quality of Airpods are not as great as quality wired earphones, however is expected due to its wireless form. They are easy to connect to the phone via a prompt that automatically pops up once the airpod case is opened, and are very portable, easy to charge, & have a stable connection."
88,"This product is very simple and easy to use, the sound is high in quality. In addition, the battery can last for over 24 hours. It is a very good product but the price is slightly high.  Also it is very convenient when i am driving the car which makes me happy."
89,"I bought AirPods and I loved them so much! Used them every single day, every single minute! I’ve sadly list them and I don’t remember where, then I found out that your can track them on “Find Iphone” but only when they’re out of the charging box, which they are not so that’s ridiculous, I’m so sad that Apple has chosen to do it that way cause they were seriously my life and they are not cheap, so that’s the only bad thing about them, other then that, they’re amazing! Now I have to go back to wired headphones and it makes me so sad."
90,"The headphones are obsessive, I’m not supposed to like the AirPods. In the category of truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods are the best I’ve yet heard. they are convenient however are way to over priced and definitely a nice product but get dirty to easily and are just to expensive"
91,"The battery life can lasts for 24 hours but in fact i think it can lasts for more than 24 hoursSimple and easy to use, the sound is high in qualityUsing this can reduce my pressure and “weight” as there’s no wireThe thing is much better and easier to store than the other one with wire as this one is like a little box, no need to use a clip to clip those wire"
92,"I love these. I had tried Bluetooth headphones before, but they always required so much extra work to get them to connect and keep charged. I tried two or three before and it was such a pain finding and holding small rubber buttons. I know these may look silly to some people, but I love how easy it is to use. The audio quality is quite good as well, compared to the over-ear sport earbuds I picked up from the grocery store. I originally got these to use for a video interview (and work involving lots of video chats) since they are wireless and have a microphone, and for that purpose they were awesome. I prefer earbuds to headphones because the pressure from headphones gives me a headache and makes me break out around my ear."
93,"With the exception of size (which does not cater for users with a small ear canal, the product revealed itself as a superior product to all the others I have tried previously. The quality of the sound, the reliability in usage and the ruggedness of the wiring makes it a very good buy."
94,These have to be the best product from Apple. The fucntionality is brilliant and the sound is crystal clear. The sound could be louder and that will probably come eventually. The battery life on the unit and the case is completely fine. No real complaints from me. Would recommend to anyone
95,"My Daughter loves these so much. They are superbly easy to setup and great sound quality. The only bad thing is the price. They don't fall out it seems, she still has them both. She often has just one in. I guess the only thing is be careful wearing them in places where you might get mugged, ( like much of Melbourne :-) )"
96,I use one earbud almost every day while at work so I can listen to music quietly and am still able to be aware of what is going on around me. It is also very handy should my phone ring.
97,"The battery life and charging speed is very impressive, as is the sound quality."
98,"The range of the connection is fairly significant. I can be several rooms away, with thick walls between my phone or Mac and they don't loose connection."
99,Comfortable to wear and they don't fall out.
100,I would buy again in a heart beat!
101,Amazing earphones that don’t fall out of your ear and are super comfy! Don’t know what I would do without them now. The sound is really clear and does not hurt your ears at all like lost other earphones. You can definitely not go wrong with these earphones and are much better than my previous beats.
102,"A fantastic product without the need of the annoying cables that always disturb you while you're doing exercises. The sound quality is great and it's very easy to connect to your phone, it so comfortable that it wont fall out that easily compare to other headphones in the market.The only negative comment is the price."
103,"Love these earphones, comfortable fit in my ears. As other reviewers have stated, being wireless and not being tied to a device is amazing, it's a freedom you don't know how great until you try it! Great sound and seamless connection between my macOS and iOS devices. Love the way the case charges the pods while being stored away."
104,"Negatives are the price, they just aren't cheap. If the battery life was a little longer but 5hrs listening time and then 15 minutes charge gives you 2hrs more listening time is good."
105,Otherwise I don't have anything bad to say about these earphones.
106,I was very unsure if I should get Apple air pod. Now that I have them I Love them. It’s crazy how much difference no cables makes not getting  tangled up or having it ripped out of your ear because the cable has clipped your arm haha I don’t miss that. But I do think they are a bit over priced for what is out there.
107,"I have been using these earphones all my life and they never fail me. The sound quality is great and they don’t fall out that easily. I’ve never owned any earphones other than these ones and I’m not ready to switch today as they never fail me, high recommend these"
108,The airpods are nice in the sense of handling as you get rid of the tangled wires of headphones and are comfortable to use. However the airpods have not so good battery life and it runs out when you make a 2 3 hours voice call or continuos music. Because of the size you can easily lose them and they are very difficult to find unless they are in their dock.
109,"Lightweight and work seamlessly with my apple devices. Its great not having to untangle the cords every time you want to use them, but you do need to make sure you have charged them which can catch you out. I think they could come up with a better design as they don't fit particularly well (small ears) and look a bit strange the way they hang out."
110,"Absolutely fantastic earphones, great sound, lightweight, portable, good charge, quick charging too. All round quite awesome, although they are quite expensive. And that is a major downside for lots of people including myself, for $200 they'd want to be really good, thankfully they are. The gestures are great and the range and Bluetooth quality of them is quite outstanding!"
111,"Great earphones that I use everyday for working out and when at work. Sits really well in the ear and doesn't fall out. Battery is great an especially because you charge them all the time in the case. The case can can dirty quite quickly soo need a lot of cleaning, but wouldn't change them for any other"
112,"I have a Samsung 8 and surprisingly the airpods work on my phone even though I don't get full features as the iPhone would but I can still listen to music, pause it by tap and answer calls."
113,I use ear phones everyday so no cords and easily hidden is what I've been waiting for.
114,I love Samsung but unfortunately their ear buds aren't the right shape of ear piece that I like in my ears.
115,Love my AirPods for work as they mean cords don’t get in the way when I’m typing. I can also take them out to do something and when I pop them back in the music picks up right where I left off. They are more comfortable than other Apple ear phones too which is a bonus. The case that charges them is a great handy feature and also good to make sure you don’t misplace them.
116,It does it's job. Great quality audio for music and calls. Fits nicely in the ears. Plus all the benefits of wireless mic/headphones.I mostly use it for calls.
117,"Now the gripes because of the high price you pay. It would have been a 5 star otherwise.1, No volume control. No,  I dont want to use Siri and I dont like to interrupt a good listening experience or phone call with my own voice command to change the volume. Some sort of touch code to adjust the volume would have been very handy.2, Random times it takes a while to recognise that it is in the ears. Especially if I put it in the ears while a call is happening. Some times the call can switch automatically to Air Pod, sometimes I have to manually connect it via BlueTooth.Hopefully next gen will have faster 'ear recognition'"
118,"They have a great sound quality, connect to all Apple devices easily, everywhere no matter what. Don’t have to have internet to work. They are cordless and don’t get in the way, charge on the lasts a decent amount of money. They are great for small ears or if you have trouble with other earphones. Definitely worth the money I paid for them, would recommend to anyone."
119,"Got this as a gift and I am really happy with it! Sound is great, I have never lost connection with my phone (yet) and it is quite comfy in my ears too. Maybe the only good an bad thing about it is that it is so small I have almost lost it twice already. :)"
120,"I received these as a  birthday gift 2 months ago and use them every single day! So great for walking or running, no more pulling them out by accident when my arms are swinging.  Great for making phone calls and being totally hands free! These are the best invention! Love them!"
121,"It's overpriced, firstly. Like $100 each ear piece. I mean Apple is getting pricey with their products. It's not worth the money to be honest. I understand the purpose of this wireless piece of metal, but if you're just forgetfull and clumsy, it won't work for you. It's been lost several times."
122,The small storage container that they get charged in is so handy - otherwise i probably would have lost one or both by now. They have really good sound quality and it's so easy to not have to worry about a tangle of cords.The biggest downside for me is they can only connect to one apple id at a time.
123,"The normal apple wired Earpods work great for me allowing me all day listening to podcasts without putting pressure on my ears. The Airpods are fractionally heavier so not quite as comfortable. Also listening to Audiobooks I find after a couple of hours the battery is is running out. The integration with the iPhone is top notch, easily the best bluetooth experience I've ever had."
124,"I was sceptical about these, being so expensive, but have definitely been converted. I haven't previously found ear-bud headphones that were comfortable to wear and didn't pop out, but these are super comfy and, being cord free, you don't suddenly get tangled up and have them pop out. Sound quality is good, charging case is excellent."
125,"why did i wait so long to buy the apple AirPods ? i don't know but they are by far the best headphones i ever had . I was a little worried that they won't stay in my ears when i walk  or run around , but they stay in my ears without a problem.The sound is great and the battery case makes sure i always have charge to get me true the day .A must for any iPhone user ."
126,"Great sound quality, no issues wearing them during exercise or on a dog walk/run. Easy to set up and modify the controls. Battery life can sometimes be a bit of a pain but the charge on the case is great so they charge up again pretty speedily. Huge improvement from other headphones, and removes the issues with not being able to listen to music while charging the iPhone 8 without the headphone jack."
127,I bought my Apple AirPods a few weeks ago and so far I’m very happy! My friends gave me excellent feedback so I decided I would buy some too.Apple AirPods give out amazing sound with clarity and bass. I use these at gym and for talking heads free on the phone because the microphone is excellent and the clarity in the voice is perfect.AirPods are very easy to use just simply pair using Bluetooth ( for me Apple iPhone 7+ or iPad Air2) one time and when ever you take the AirPods out of the case they automatically sync to the device. If you take 1  AirPod out of your ear the AirPods pause what’s playing/ what you’re listening to.very handy for gym and when ever you want music on the go.5 Stars!
128,"Ok, so I shall be honest here, and to the point, Yes these are good, however I have had them fail on me, I had to get a replacement, so these are prone to failure, like most Electrical devices, the replacement process took a long time, though I will say that was more than likely my fault as i was not available whenever they contacted me, I'm no Audiophile so i cannot judge the Sound Quality, The pairing process was easy if you have an Apple Device, I cannot speak for Android users tho, Overall, these are not bad, but they are not perfect by any means."
129,"My partner and I have always used the earphones with the cord but was getting fed up with the constant tangling and eventually breaking so decided to give the airpods a go.   We used a generic brand at first but they were terrible.  Only gave us an hour and a half playback so decided to bite the bullet and buy the Apple brand.  We are extremely happy with them.  We get 4 and bit hours of playback before they let you know with a little beep that they are about to die.  They are so easy to pair to whichever device you wish to use and the clarity is tremendous.  Just open the case next to your device and bingo, all done."
130,"The Apple air pods work perfectly. Pairing with devices is straightforward and explained well in the manual. The airpods connect to the nearest switched on device almost instantly as soon as I put them in my ears. Sound quality is much better than I expected from a device with such a small form factor. Perfect for watching movies, listening to music, playing games, audio books and anything else you need sound for."
131,"The AirPods are the only pair of Bluetooth headphones that actually fit my ears. Yes, they are expensive; but this downfall is made up for in other areas (sound quality, integration with Apple devices etc). I love how I only have to open the case to connect my AirPods to my iPhone. So much easier than navigating through my cluttered home screen and pairing them manually in settings like other Bluetooth headphones require. Some people suggest the AirPods are easy to loose. I would say that statement is inaccurate. If you place the AirPods straight back in the charging case after use, you shouldn't loose them. The battery life is absolutely incredible! I can easily get a week of use before the case and the AirPods themselves need to be charged. And charging is super quick with the 2017 MacBook Pro's Thunderbolt 3 port. I just love how well Apple devices work together!!"
132,These AirPods are an absolute game changer - as a runner they are such a valuable accessory and worth every cent. They allow me to exercise without cords getting in the way and they integrate beautifully with the Apple Watch.
133,"I've not had any issues with the Pods falling out of my ears, they fit like a glove and the sound quality is great. The case they come in is really clever; it's a portable charging station which is great for people like me who forget to change everything."
134,"If you're considering buying these, I wouldn't even hesitate. They're practical, classy and high tech."
135,"Overall 9/10. These are perfect for all day use. Good battery life, quick charge, and good sound. However for heavy runs in the morning, I found the left earbud would start falling out with sweat. I'm going to try and find a rubber tip cover that might fix this. I wish apple would have instigated a design with rubber tips, rather than the hard plastic. However it's not bad at all, just a nit pick."
136,"Have the Apple AirPods for a few months and they are so good I bought another two pairs for my family. First they are so convenient.  You just can't go back to wired earphones especially when you are outdoors. Second they sound surprisingly good.  I mean better than normal Apple Earpods. Third the battery life is good (around 5 hours listening per charge). Only con is the high price.  I hope next gen gets noise cancelling feature without increasing price. If you want wireless earphones and don't mind the price tag, just buy these.  There are no better wireless earphones at the moment IMO."
137,Air pods are the best for hands free communication while on you go or while you work. I really loved.Pros:1. Easy to configure your brand new airpods to your phone2. simple Steps3. High quality sound4. Reduced noise
138,"Cons:1. there is no visual or  sensual communication for the user to understand on Airpods are on low battery and they need to charge, other the seeing on phone2. I kept listening and all of sudden I saw there is no audio on my left ear, however left one is still rendering the audio. Then I try all the tires and later I figured out that its running out of battery."
139,"Suggest for Improving:Users can't keep tracking the battery of pods on phone very frequently. I suggest once the battery charge comes down to 20%, there should be a voice message from siri or her boy friend telling your airpords are about to die and ask user to charge  the battery."
140,"I was sceptical, I will admit that.  I also wasn't a fan of how they looked at the beginning."
141,After purchasing a pair more than a month ago I was instantly smitten.  They fit very well and unless my hair gets snagged around them (as I have long hair) they don't fall out.
142,The battery life is very good and sound quality matches.  I have had no issues whatsoever since the initial purchase.  And I would like to add that the initial pairing/set up is a breeze.  Takes about 10-20 seconds.  They really are that good.
143,It's also really nice to have bothersome cords that don't tangle.
144,And yes they are on the higher end of the cost scale but they are comparable to the likes of the higher end brands (such as BOSE etc).
145,"AirPods are so small and fits easily in my bag / makeup bag. I no longer need to untangle wires. The only thing is if you are using it at work and your hair is covering it, people doesn't know you are on earphone and they will call you multiple times until you response to them, they might think why you are not responding to them ha ha. But of cuz depending how loud you set the volume to."
146,"Don't know how I lived without these for so long. Very comfortable - you can easily forget that you are wearing them. And they don't fall out when running/working out. Definitely worth the money. If the original Apple earphones fit you, these will fit. These are a great alternative to uncomfortable, ill-fitting in ear headphones."
147,These Apple ear pods are the next best thing. The sound quality these AirPods produce is amazing and groundbreaking. They are so comfortable in the ear and are quite a fashionable accessory. Apple has yet come out with another amazing invention. The cordless headset means it’s so easy to use them where ever and whenever discretely.
148,"I purchased a set of AirPods yesterday after alot of research. For me, It was a choice between the AirPods and the Bose Soundsport Free."
149,I ultimately decided on the AirPods as they ticked a few extra boxes for me. I have a few Apple products already and Apple assured me if I didn’t like them I could return within two weeks no questions asked.
150,"I unboxed them at work, synced within seconds perfectly. Sounded great. Made a phone call, perfect as expected. Comfortable, unobtrusive, great sound simple and easy to use. Love them already."
151,"Got to the gym at lunch, FAIL!!!!! Grrrrr “sad face”"
152,"I started walking on the treadmill, all good. Then moved into jogging at 6km/hr, right one fell out after five steps. Nearly lost it under the treadmill. Removed them, ran for a warmup km listening to the gym music playing instead. Thinking that running with them is out of the question lets try weights instead."
153,"Standing bicep curls and Tricep Extensions, perfect, no problems at all. Gravity keeps them in check."
154,"Tried laying down for bench press, FAIL!!!! Constantly trying to contain them in my ears. Both sides fell out 2-3 times each during my lying exercises. Of course the music stops every time one is removed. Very distracting."
155,"Think to myself, that’s it I’m taking them back. Ill get the Bose instead."
156,Turns out my ear cavities are quite large and not suited to the standard AirPods size or shape. I never used the EarPods before as Ive always preferred my QC 35’s when not in the gym so I couldn’t compare them to the AirPods.
157,"But I really like the ease, simplicity, effortlessness as well as the case battery life of the AirPods (24hrs!!!). I really don’t want to return them. Decide to see if others have had the same issues and what solutions work best for them before I make my decision."
158,I came across NewZealandMatt’s post on Mac Rumours through a google search and decided it was worth a try. Popped down to my local Chemist Warehouse and found the Nexcare Absolute Waterproof Tape for $7.49.
159,"Got home and placed a couple of spots on each AirPod in the same location as Matt. WOW!!! What a difference. They fit perfectly and the sound is soooooo much better than before. No jiggle or movement at all. Layed down on the floor and they did not budge. Best of all, no interference at all with the case closing."
160,"Its almost lunch time, so I will report back after my next gym session about how they perform after my modifications."
161,"Again, a massive thanks to NewZealandMatt for sharing this solution.  For those sitting on the fence, this is definitely worth a try."
162,"I lost my recent one a few months ago so I bought a new oneThis looks really good as i like the colour white, the shape of it shows that the surface is really smooth and it also sounds greatAlthough my mum is not using Apple, she is also using this Apple Airpods, so i think she also likes thisHope this will help"
163,"The Apple Airpods are very nice. Starting off with the sound quality, it is what you expect from Apple, not the best but hey what can you do. The design is very questionable. The design isn't really what you want to wear in public. The do sit securely in you ear but you can still very easily hear background noise. Another bad thing is the price, more than $200 for an average pair of headphones is a stretch. Still good though as they are an Apple branded earphones."
164,I love the Apple AirPods. They have amazing sounds and base and plenty of battery life. I charge it maybe once a week. Great quality and I can still hear background noise while I’m walking around. These are worth the $219 spent.Great for the gym and they never fall out.
165,"I've found Apple's AirPods to be really convenient with good sound for the category. They are comfortable and sit securely in my ears. They've never felt like they're going to slip out and the only accidents I've had are when I physically knock them out, but they still work fine. They are very easy to pair with all your Apple devices - pair them with one and they're paired with all (including Macs). It's a cinch to have whichever device you're using send audio to them - easier than Straight Blue tooth in my experience. Audio (not phone calls though) stops playing if you remove one of the buds and resumes when you place it back in your ear. I've had no complaints from others about phone call quality."
166,The only downside of this type of bud is there's no acoustic seal so you have to pump up the volume above ambient levels.
167,"Who can compare with Apple anything really?These are the best earbuds by far, you just plug them into you phone and away you go, if it’s anogine call or you listening to music these are the earphone you want.The sound is clear and music had never sounded better"
168,I bought these to go with my iPhone X. They are good to use but not entirely sure they are worth the money. The sound is good nice and clear but I wouldn’t rave about the quality. Battery life is pretty decent and they charge pretty quickly. Generally a good product
169,"Good quality sound, good price. Damaged the ones that came with my phone and bought new ones because I missed them so much Comfortable and don’t fall out of ear. Keep coming back to them instead of my more expensive Bose . Annoying they can only be used on apple products . Would purchase again despite this flaw"
170,"These blew my mind.. I was a bit sketchy about these before I bought them, wasn't sure how it would go or sound. But far out, was I ever shown that they are an amazing product.. I have had them for about 7 months now, and never had a problem. They never fall out, they are so quick to charge and take forever to drain. I accidentally put them through the wash as well, and there was no problem.. Worked perfect afterwards. People may not like the $229 price tag, but trust me, they are worth it! Every cent!"
171,"Comfortable to wear and convenient to carry around in its case (that also recharges it). The lack of wires made it a lot more easy to move around and do stuff while listening to music and/or doing sports. On the down side, it's a little pricery (I got it for ~200AUD). Easy to connect and got a lot of use out of it."
172,"Super convenient, stays put in ear, can run walk jog and is comfortable in the ear. So clear for user and recipient. I was wary the recipient may not have clear exchange, but with a few tests was convinced with the sound quality. So discreet yet stylish. No wires, no hassle, love this product and it’s connectivity!"
173,"I’ve been lusting after these headphones for months now, and I finally bit the bullet a week ago. They’re everything that was promised; insanely fast setup, great battery life and audio/mic quality, and very freeing. I’ve pnly had technical issues with a windows 10 laptop, but they’re great with iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch."
174,"I’m just still not quite convinced by the price point. I was a bit impatient and bought them full price, but I do still have a bit of buyers remorse. If I were to do it again, I probably would still make the purchase, but I’d wait til a reasonable sale."
175,I had many other Bluetooth headphones and they were not truely wireless. They look fantastic and are not obstructive. I do wish they came in black but I guess its apples decisionThey work fantastic on my iPhone and were better than my beats which were $350. So works with my android tablet
176,"The AirPods are very convienient and has made my life a lot easier. They feel nice in my ear and are very light. The sound is nice and clear and the effects are very useful. The battery life lasts forever and it never worries me, the earphones it’s self nearly always stay at 100% and I only need to charge he case every two weeks or so."
177,"Early adopter and happy with my purchase.I left them at home recently and has to use wired headphones, didnt realise how used i had gotten to wireless, wont be going back. Running with them is fine, no dramas. Charge is good because im at a desk all day and can charge them whenever, if youre only able to charge them once a day and want to listen all day, then no dice"
178,"The Apple AirPods are an excellent pair of earphones. Initially I was slightly skeptical of non-wired devices, however through using the earphones for some time I found them incredibly high-quality. They feel no different to regular apple Ear Phones, and the sound quality is a treat to listen to. What's more is that the hassle of no wires keeps the device organised, alongside it's handy carry case. Would highly recommend this product!"
179,"These earphones make listening so easy. They connect automatically when you open the case, they start playing when you put them in your ear, you can activate siri or change songs by tapping on them, they stop playing when you take them out. The smaller battery life is made up by the fact you get an additional 24 hours charge just by leaving them in the case. Brilliant."
180,"I gave in to all the hype and I'm so glad I did. These aren't great for the sound quality (it's good but not riveting) but rather for their convenience. I've found myself listening to music a lot more frequently in places and scenarios I didn't before. It's so easy to open the case, pop the buds in, then double tap one to start playing music where you left off. Sure beats the hassle of detangling a cord then finding music through your device."
181,"For lifting and running, these have been fantastic. Previously, I'd used wired Panasonic earbuds for exercising, and the cord would always tug down or sideways while exercising. Now I don't have this trouble. I've set up my AirPods so that double tapping the left one starts and stops music, while double tapping the right one skips to the next song. This convenience makes controlling music a lot less cumbersome when exercising."
182,"And, importantly, AirPods make the dream of listening to music through earbuds while gardening or cleaning without pants on a reality."
183,"One thing that's a pain is that you don't get any sort of notification when the case is low on charge. Sure, you can check the battery status in your Today View's Batteries widget, but that requires the case being open and near the phone. Or you can realise that if you open the case with the AirPods still inside and the LED is orange, it means the case is low on battery. In addition to the lack of significant battery notification, there's no non-Siri way to directly control the volume on these, and that can be frustrating at times."
184,"IPhone connection is good, but laptop connection keeps dropping out. Love the battery life. And sound quality is same as Apple earphones. Bought from jbhifi for $185."
185,It may not fit perfectly on your ear and may have to adjust it. Adjusting volume is bit troublesome. Either you ask Siri or do it from your phone
186,I am so happy with my Apple AirPods. I use them every day  The freedom that you have to move around without headphone cords is amazing. My favourite time to use them is during exercise. it makes the time whoosh by. Just make sure you return them to their case after each use as they are an investment worth looking after. Highly recommend.
187,Extremely happy with this product. They connect instantly with my phone and are perfect for the gym and for hiding them under your hair. I am able to make calls using them and my voice sounds clear to the other person. The battery life on these is better then my phone battery and I love that you can use the charging case when you're out if the AirPods go flat. They're pretty expensive but honestly so worth it.
188,I have bought apple airpod few days back. I liked the product very much. It connects with phone seamlessly without any issue. I have never seen any bluetooth which works as good as airpods. Double tap feature to receive the call is awesome. I would strongly recommend to go for airpods.
189,I’m using the AirPods with my iPhone X now but they worked excellent with my iPhone 6S too. The best thing about them is that they literally work out of the box. The setup process is a breeze and feels like magic. If you have an iPhone this is a must have accessory.
190,"These are some of the best earphones i have used. the old earpods were not good in my ears, but these fit perfectly. The battery lasts long enough and the fact that they come with a charging case is GENIUS! they JUST work and honestly they are magical. Touch port on the side for siri or answering calls is amazing, and they so easily switch from my phone to my laptop to my desktop or my ipad! apple has hit the jackpot! Can get them for around 190 if they are on sale, but usually 229!"
191,"I absolutely love AirPods, despite the fact that they do not fit in my ears at all. An easy way to test this before you buy, is by trying our the EarPods that come with your iPhone - they're the same size, despite the differing form factor. If they fit you well (and it seems they do fit most people well...) then you're in for a magical experience."
