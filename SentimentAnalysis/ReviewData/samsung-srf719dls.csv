0,"I love the option of having 2 freezers or 1 freezer and an extra fridge space, which is the way I use the fridge."
1,But this fridge is not without its issues. It is well built but I had to give it a bad review because of the issues. The drawers for vegetables are too hard to remove from the fridge to clean them as the doors won't open wide enough to get them out.
2,BUT the big issue is with the ice maker. I travel a bit so am away for weeks at a time so that while I'm away the ice maker freezes over and on my return it won't work. Having read reviews here and overseas this is a major problem with Samsung fridges. I have had 2 service calls in 12 months for the same issue. The first time a mechanism in the ice maker was replaced and now the computer has been replaced. This time it took the serviceman over 20 minutes to steam the ice loose so that he could open the ice maker as it had completely frozen over! No wonder I couldn't get it to to open...
3,Here's hoping this works because if it doesn't I expect a new working fridge from Samsung.
4,"I have had problems with my Samsung french door fridge for 2 years now.  Samsung promised to repair it and put me onto a local company RQ in Melbourne who said they would fix it.  They changed parts of the ice maker but it still ices up in back of the fridge.  The fridge is very cold and vegetables freeze up.  I would not touch a Samsung fridge again, beware if buying, Samsung just don't care.  Im taking this to court and am suggesting a class action - please get in touch if you wish to join.  There is something seriously wrong with this fridge"
5,Ice maker broke within 12 months was told they would fix it and if it broke again offer a refund. 4 weeks later and two goes at fixing it broken again. Repairer informed it was a design fault and all Samsung fridges with ice makers so I asked for refund. Samsung refusing to refund now want a forth go at fixing it and claim they will not refund me just keep fixing. Fridge work ok but I paided for a fridge with a ice maker not to keep taking days off work to have someone have a go at fixing a 12month old fridge.
6,"Not every family needs a double door fridge with icemaker but for us it makes a difference. Icemaker works fine, we haven't had any trouble with it. Only thing I wish is the tubs in the freezer were shaped a bit better for stacking food"
7,This fridge is very reliable and has 1 shelf that will open for your taller items. The main negative is there is no build in lock function so my 2 year old just opens the freezer doors and helps himself all the time and it's such a pretty fridge would be nice to have a lock full action instead of using ugly stick on child locks.
8,"Really wanted this fridge and saved for a long time. For $4k it’s not worth the outlay when it does the same things a fridge half the price would do. The ice maker after one year started freezing up and has done so for the past year every month. We have to used a hairdryer every time now to thaw the inside mechanism and then it works for a little while and then all happens again. We run the fridge at the recommended temp so I have no idea why. Great big space inside but heaps of wasted space. When I emptied my last tiny fridge contents into this one, I filled it to the max straight up!! Heaps of room to wave a wand inside but ....???"
9,This was an upgrade from our old fridge and is much bigger and better equipped.  No complaints at this stage and off to a good start.  Cools well and quickly and maintains a good stable temperature.  The freezer is stable and works well also and has plenty of room compared to our old one
10,"Let me first say that I love this refrigerator. Has enough room for everything. It is a counter depth refrigerator so it fit right where we needed it to be...but....as with others that I see on the reviews, our ice cube freezer ices up and we have to defrost it. I had a protection plan and they came to fix it, but it happened again 1 month after repair. My plan had ended so there will be no new fixing, which doesn't seem to help anyway. Today I was going to reach out to Samsung but I can see by the other reviews that this is a wasted effort as Samsung does not seem to care. Shame on you Samsung that you continue to sell your product but don't fix an issue that many owners are experiencing."
11,"We're happy with the fridge performance and it gets lots of positive comments about it's looks but the door has since purchase made a horrible noise (like a weird bird squeaking is how I'd best describe it).  Purchased from Winnings who graciously offered to call for a service on our behalf, missed a call from Samsung on my mobile around a week later then when I rang them back I spent around 30 minutes on the phone to try to book a service call in without my serial number (which I didn't take to work with me). It was almost impossible but after so much time I didn't want to have to call back again so insisted on speaking to a supervisor and finally they booked a service call.  Samsung management must be hard to work for, the poor guys in the service department tried very hard to get me to almost analyse what I could do to the fridge doors to fix the problem myself without a service call.  Questions like ""Do the doors align at the top?"" ""Have you tried to find out if the seal is properly installed"" were asked.  I told them that I work (which surprised them that I couldn't dedicate a whole day to the fridge repair), it's important I work to help pay for the fridge and the food in it I suggested.  Anyway, I hope the repair will go smoothly, there's even a printed piece of paper I have to sign to give them before they will touch the fridge (so they get paid for their repair I suppose).  All this took ages to organise and I was left wondering is this nice looking fridge all worthwhile?  P.S. When I use the icemaker I have to be careful it doesn't spit ice shavings all over the floor by covering the front of the container the ice goes into but apart from that we have been using it for around 9 months and are happy with the performance of the fridge and the internal configeration suits us too."
12,"The fridge never preformed in the way it was intended to. I read a few reviews about this fridge, but thought that they may not be true. I went and bought the fridge regardless. The freezer is the worst I've seen in my life. Ice-cream will NOT freeze always runny, water in a 600ml bottle will take 3 days to freeze and not 100% frozen. Have set to lowest temp, mid temp, did the quick freeze but didn't work.I've been a big Samsung fan and that is why I bought the fridge, but this experience changes everything."
13,The motor of fridge is noisy and runs for long extended times even if the doors are opened at minimal times. We tested both freezer doors below by placing the same bottle of 600ml water in the same location of each door at the same time. We did this a few times and never are they consistent or freeze fully...
14,If your after looks ONLY and don't care about runny ice cream and food not freezing then yeah make the mistake I did.
15,"I will be returning the fridge and not accepting repairs. I don't pay over $3000 on an item to have it repaied.So disappointed with Samsung and all the negative reviews relating to this product and costumer service that I'm really considering boycotting Samsung. Ill swap both my note 9 to an apple, all the family tabs to ipads and my Samsung tv to an LG... very disappointed."
16,"Bought a $3900 dollar fridge from SamsungThe worst mistakeIce maker crapFridge guarantee crapDealing with Samsung,you get better reaction talking to a wallDon't buy a Samsung fridgeSamsung was told about fridge in NovemberNow january still waitingMy Advice don't deal with themMy Name is Jix Michels   I live in Kurnell my email is jix@tpg.com.au"
17,"I will start my review by saying we are very happy with the fridge size, capacity, variable options and look, so far this is a great fridge with a flaw.We can also say we can not fault the servicing we have received from Samsung.  I do say service as the day of delivery on the 17 December 2018 a few hours after installation we noticed a water leak from under the fridge over the kitchen floor. We turned off the water tap and checked all the fixtures were correct. Plugged in again and few hours later yet again still leaking. A service call was placed and a Samsung contractor was very quick to respond and attend. This must be a regular fault as the service man walked straight in and dismantled the ice dispenser and replaced with the a new one he had specifically brought with him.The leak was now fixed but still not able to get cold water. The manual said to allow a little time for this. After 2 days we still had tepid water from the dispenser. When Samsung rang to check the leak was fixed and we advised the water issue and they said someone would be in contact soon. We did not hear from anyone so raised another service call to which they did respond very quickly but also assured us on the phone that the water should be cold. A repair man was here the next day. He knew exactly what we had a problem with and said he has to attend to this nearly every day.  This fridge does not dispense cold water at all and never will.  This is apparently the problem of having an ice dispenser. We specifically went to purchase a fridge that dispensed cold water, we did not require and did not want an ice maker in any capacity.  We went above budget to purchase this fridge for the cold water dispenser but also due to the option the freezer could be used as a fridge instead.  Apparently the only fridges that dispense cold water are the side by side. We were not told this at the time of purchase as this would have made a change to our purchase. Not happy at all that we paid over $3000 for a water filter.I will finish my review on the fridge itself in saying the space in the fridge is great as we have now gone from 2 regular sized fridges to just one.  The option to have one space as a fridge or freezer is also a bonus as we do require more fridge than freezer space with our lifestyle and now that I still have to keep water bottles in the fridge."
18,There’s a door for the fridge that does not close easily and we always have to go back to close it. The water filter and ice is really cool and convenient. The inside is a bit small which is weird considering the size of it. The colour is great very fitting and not noticeable when it’s dirty on the outside
19,"ve our new Samsung Fridge. Love the space, and the ability to covert freezer space to additional fridge space."
20,"Clean design and lines, easy to open and close doors, and good water and ice dispenser. Enough space for our large family, and for entertaining. Look likes like a nice high-end fridge."
21,"We bought our fridge about 18 months ago.  Love, love, love the fridge.  Its amazing how much you can fit into it considering it doesn't look as large as it truly is.  Use the facility of converting the fridge to freezer.  However, not long after having it, we did have issues with the ice maker which we use all the time.  It continually  faltered. From dripping, to then freezing and then to not working at all (even after doing all the proper checks and home maintenance).  The first two times the faulty component was replaced.  After the third fault with the same part, a report was written to Samsung by the technician.  He felt it would always be an issue,  I think we were just unlucky.  Not once did Samsung accuse us of it being User Error, nor did the  technicians.  Samsung within no time offered us either our money back or total replacement.  As we love our fridge so much, we decided on the replacement.  We were originally given 7-21 days before delivery.  Didn't even wait a week, and it arrived on Christmas Eve (today).  Amazing.  Having had experiences of faulty appliances in the past (not Samsung) they are usually quick to blame the user.  Not in this case at all.  We usually end up continually replacing parts, often at our cost.  Their customer care is second to none and I will not hesitate at all in purchasing more Samsung products in the future."
22,"Love our new Samsung Fridge. Love the space, and the abilty to covert freezer space to additional fridge space."
23,"Clean design and lines, easy to open and close doors, and good water and ice dispenser. Enough space for our large family, and for entertaining. Look likes like a nice high end fridge."
24,This refrigerator is the best. Love how it has a bunch of space and easy to clean. Easy to make ice and doesn't take alot of power to run. Bright light for the night when wanting a quick snack. Very convenient to slide on floor. Not a bad price. High quality. Yes. Recommend to friends.
25,We love our fridge! The space is adaptable so we can change things around when we’re entertaining so That all the different platters etc. fit! The ice maker is great! Saves room in the freezer and holds a good amount of ice. It can be a bit noisy when refilling but you can turn it off if you need to.
26,"My samsung refrigerator is 5 years old and it is already ready to be thrown into trash. About 16 months after we bough it the ice maker stopped working. We went around that by turning off the ice maker completely and turning the entire refrigerator off for two weeks until it melted. After that we never used the ice maker. It just turned 5 years and off course warranty expired. Just one month after the warranty expired the fridge part stopped working. Called Samsung they sent a technician who said it is the compressor and due to the special gas in it we cannot fix it. It simply cannot be fixed due to that special gas since no one is licensed/certified to handle that gas. Please don't buy any samsung refrigerators you would regret it greatly. I had read this kind of reviews prior to buying this refrigerator but I didn't take it seriously. I regret that very much now. As one reviewer said ""this was the most beautiful piece of crap I have every owned"". I learned the hard way beauty is not enough it needs to work as well."
27,"We have been using this Samsung refrigerator for 8 years now it has given excellent service recently a first damage we had was a door spring the technician visited our place and replaced it for $25/- great service and very timely service, the technician was very helpfull and also provided some valuable tips love the refrigerator"

29,"Very impressed with this Fridge, would buy again!! Highly recommend this Fridge to anyone who is happy to spend on a Fridge that will last a long time, I have other friends who have purchased this Fridge and have not had any issues with it at all. Great purchase !"
30,Well it was going fine until about a month ago when we noticed that foods in the refrigerator section were not overly cold and going off very quickly ! Freezer seemed to be OK.Temperature had been set at 3 degrees from day dot.
31,"Called up the ( overseas ) call centre and organised a repair man to come out and have a look.Was advised to turn the fridge off to see if that would reset the computer, it didn't ! Well , it did , it reset the bottom right hand "" Freezer "" section back to a fridge, so all the frozen items in that side were defrosted ( and lost ).Repair man said that the compressor in the fridge section was gone , it could be fixed , but that would only last 18 months max , by then the warranty would be well and truly finished . He advised that the fridge be written off. The unit was purchased in November 2016 , so not quite 2 years old ! At least it was within warranty ( by 16 days ! ) ."
32,"As of today, I still have not had resolution from Samsung, apparently waiting on an ( Australian ) case manager to attend to my case. It's been 7 days since my case was lodged.Daily calls to the ( overseas ) call centre have not helped, there is no way of contacting anyone within Australia."
33,"If only this had occurred at the beginning of December, my Harvey Norman Extended Warranty would have kicked in and I would have been sorted out within a few days !!!"
34,"Be aware, the fridge was good ( when it worked ) , the warranty support has let this down !I will NOT be purchasing another Samsung Fridge !"
35,"***  Update  ***During the writing of this review I was actually on hold with the Call Centre ( again ) and was eventually put through to a Case Manager in Australia.There appears to be a fair amount of rigmarole attached to the process of refunding my money. Refunds can take a few weeks !Samsung still want to collect the old unit, it will be sitting in my garage ,as I need to get myself a new fridge !"
36,I loved this fridge until it started to riday under the finish at the bottom of the doors.  Of course nothing cant be done because it was just out of warranty.  Considering the investment cost of this product.. I'm very disappointed and will continue to be until I make my final payment on the credit line taken to purchase it and I can replace it.
37,"The Good.The fridge has a large capacity which is assisted by there being no central vertical bar to impede access when you open the two french doors. To get around the issue of sealing, a “flip out” bar is attached to the left door which swings into position when that door is closed. There is a warning in the Manual alerting users to be careful when closing the door that this bar is still in the retracted position but we have never experienced any issue with this. It works flawlessly.The fridge is super quiet. Even after putting your ear up to it, it is still next to impossible to hear anything. (There is one exception to this. See in the “Not So Good” section below)Beneath the two main french doors are two smaller french doors. The one on the left is the bottom mount freezer. The one on the right can be used for a number of purposes. You can choose to set it as an extension to your normal fridge section or you can set it as an extension to your freezer. It's a great idea and it works well. I have seen some other reviews claiming people were unhappy with the freezer temperature (some claiming they couldn't get it lower than -4). Happy to say after 24hrs from first installation, I was able to use a digital thermometer to measure and confirm a temperature of -18. Subsequent checks confirm it to be holding that temperature solidly. Additional to the fridge/freezer setting it also allows you a further two intermediate settings.Interior lighting is bright and covers all internal areas.Ice-maker works well and is also able to create “crushed ice” on demand. There are only two adults using it at the moment so I am unable to say how much ice is available before it runs out but we haven't experienced that yet.Interior shelving is height adjustable with one shelf having a means of folding back to allow tall bottles (and similar) on the shelf below"
38,"The Not So Good (this is really nit picky but at least you know)Ice is not clear (more white) and is not uniform in shape but I understand this is common in ice-making fridges and is caused by the rapid freezing process they must use to replace the ice quickly.As previously mentioned, the fridge is VERY quiet. However, the quietness is punctuated by a random clunking which I believe is created ice dropping into the ice storage area. It's a bit unnerving the first few times you hear it but you quickly get used it it and it only occurs over the next couple of hours until it has replenished its ice.The fridge must be plumbed in. There is no capability to top up a reserve manually. You will need to factor in the cost of a plumber installing a tap outlet adjacent to the fridge (on the wall behind it) when purchasing this fridge.Door shelving is removable but not height adjustable.If I was asked what my biggest gripe with the fridge is (its not really a big issue to be honest), I'd have to say the non-self closing doors. The four fridge doors require you to push them closed. Our previous fridge was the traditional type that if you left the door open, it would (generally) close itself. Not so the Samsung. It must be pushed closed. There is an audible alarm if the door is left open longer than two minutes but there have been a couple of times I found the door slightly ajar but not enough to leave the light on and trigger the alarm. Two adults here have learnt quickly to ensure the doors are pushed closed but children may be a problem."
39,"Overall, I would recommend this fridge. The “Not So Good” attributes are rather trivial and I have only included them for completeness."
40,The French door option creates a classy look in my kitchen with the other stainless (generic branded) appliances.  The temperature is consistent however I notice it’s more efficient when we do not open both doors at the same time.  Very easy to open and close because there’s no large items in the door shelves.
41,"I bought this fridge many months ago, and I have been thoroughly impressed by how consistent and reliable it is. I've had no freezing of any foods in the fridge, or thawing of foods in the freezer. I would totally recommend it to someone who's ready to spend a bit of money and get a fridge thats extremely reliable"
42,"I bought this fridge a few months ago, and it is amazing. I find the price quite high, but the quality is amazing so that's a plus. The doors are hard to open sometimes compared to my older fridge. The ice maker works, overall it is a good fridge that I'd recommend buying!"
43,Great working fridge with a lot of room to store items in the fridge and freezer section the fridge is excellent on power consumption the fridge is east to open and close the fridge always holds good temperature for all off your food products I would recommend this fridge to anyone
44,Our fridge freezer of almost 10 years packed in and we decided to buy the Samsung 719DSL. The ice maker works really well perfect ice every time. Only works with small cups large ones don't fit very well. The fridge its self has loads of space and shelves and the freezer is about the same
45,We have had this fridge fro almost a year and we are still feellin it!We got the darker finish and looks super classy. The unit is top quality from the finish to the way the doors open and close to the plastic drawers inside. The drawers and on rails and open and close with ease.
46,"The water unit is great. The water is slightly chilled but not too cold. No issues with the ice unit, always ice when we want it."
47,"The bottom right door we have set to Fridge mode because we have a lot of food to keep cold. No issues with this, the food does not freeze unless its in the freezer."
48,"We love this fridge, my wife and i are like the guy in his undies on the colourbond ad, sometimes we just stop and look at the fridge and take it all in."
49,"We purchased a Samsung refrigerator 3 years ago during a kitchen remodel. We have already spent $700+ in repairs and service. The defrost system broke down, leaking on our new floor and the french door mechanism has failed.  Please save yourself the time, money and aggravation and purchase another system."
50,Since purchasing I have read multiple personal (not sponsored) reviews and these all seem t be recurring themes with the Samsung refrigerator.
51,Don't buy
52,Have this fridge for 2 years and best so far. One of the bottom sides can be used as a freezer or fridge. It is very spacious and has a ice and water dispanser. Havve to change the filter every 6 months. The inside can be reorganised depending on your usage
53,"The silver matt finish might be the best choice to suit 90% kitchen decoration style. It always worth to spend a little extra money on a fridge which just able to fit into the space. As in my case, it is the most frequently used piece in the kitchen, and generated a lot happiness as I didn’t expected."
54,great fridge very reliable and doesn't cost the earth to operate. always enjoy my Samsung products as they are good value for money and doesnt just break for no reason. will always stick with Samsung. food is always fresher and cold compared to anything else i have ever bought from the fridge range
55,"I absolutely love this fridge, I have had it for about a year and never had any problems, I love the design and especially the lock function on the water to keep my little one away, and the space is a plus. There is no negative aspects of this fridge in my opinion."
56,"Large storage, flexible shelving configurations , ice maker is great, have had no issues with fridge yet 12 months in.Freezer works great and has loads of space.Cash back took a decent amount of time to receive and I had to call / chase up form memory it was at least 3 months"
57,"This fridge is pretty good, the temps are very easy to set and change and the ice maker is fairly quick only down side is the ice make is loud with the ice drops. scares you when you are not expecting it. absolutely love my fridge and would not think of any other brand"
58,"Very easy to use, huge storage space and the changing function of the bottom right hand section is so handy. We have it as a chiller, so it keeps things really cold. Deli stuff lasts ages! The humidity control in the main fridge helps keep my veggies crisper for longer and the nifty little shelf that folds up for tall bottles is perfect for storing wine or other tall bottles. The door shelves are huge and can hold heaps. We're a family of 4 and even a big shop fits in to this fridge easily. The plumbed water and ice dispenser is very convenient, even the kids can operate it."
59,"Its maintaining a consistent temperaturevery quite, plenty of roomElegant lookworth the moneyeasy to cleanhappy with the option of changing converting one section as fridge or freezer.user friendlyenergy efficienteasy to change the filterGreat purchase and happy customerDisplays temperature and love the touch screen."
60,"It maintains an excellent temperature in all compartments, never hear it and relatively easy to use and clean. I do find that if you use the second part of the freezer as a fridge you don't have a lot of freezer space which is a bit of a problem but other than that it works really well."
61,"Be careful before owning a Samsung Fridge!! The fridge design not reliable and it can breakdown anytime.We own the French doors fridge for 5 years and purchased 5 years warranty to come with it. During the 5 years, numerous problems with the fridge and the problems not fixed some time. After warranty period, the defects still come back to you. Wondering what to do now!!"
62,Great product and love the customer service . Highly recommended the brand and customer service . I have already referred few friends and will continue to do so. What an amazing feeling . I believe this is what called the quality product and amazing customer service even after sale .
63,I must say I have been very happy with my Samsung Refrigerator  no problems have occurred since I bought it and it has kept food at the right temperature and the freezer could maybe just slightly larger but it is still sufficient             for me but you have to be selective with what you buy to freeze.
64,"The fridge works fine but the so called Stainless steel got surface rust on it after a short time and we don't live near the coast! Samsung were literally the worst company to deal with in history. Arrogant and unhelpful.Even the Shelves cracked and needed replacing and Samsung refused to replace but fortunately the ""Good Guys"" paid for that themselves and said Samsung are very difficult to deal with."
65,"I have defrosted ice machine and always regularly do so along with regular filter changes apon red light which is usually every 6-8 months, contacted company under warranty and didn’t do anything for me, just noted the problem on there computer, for how much you spend on fridge rather disappointed as I love my crushed ice."
66,"The product I fill the fridge with is always fresh and perfect temperature, design is very modern & very well setup internally for packing ease.The fridge is ultra quiet and the performance is amazing, I will highly recommend to family because it is such a great item to have."
67,"My fridge is just over two years old and just out of warranty. Unfortunately, I had a problem with my ice maker fan which led to a $460 repair. The replacement part was completely redesigned, leading me to believe that I was not the only person having to replace this expensive part. When I called customer service, the rep told me that she gets a lot of calls about faulty ice makers. I have contacted the office of the president and, after an initial email asking me to contact them, they have never answered my repeated attempts to get back in touch with them either by phone or email. Unacceptable. Wish I had purchased a different brand."
68,Our new fridge is perfect.  I has both quick dispense water and ice in the door and is a non plumbed fridge. This is exactly what I have been looking for now for a long time and the only one I have found that perfection the market.  It is a great size with lots of internal space and runs great.
69,Very quiet fridge freezer easy to clean and big enough for plenty of food and drinks  the drink machine is perfect for the kids to grab a quick cold drink and no mess either. Would say money well spent here and would buy another for sure without a worry as they last
70,I love my fridge . As it is very quiet. Easy to use. Can clean  easily. Keeping good temperatures. Setting is very easy and is very useful in any climate. Very good power consumption.Enough space in all compartments. And the compartments are very adjustable.Is having no odour as  the settings are nice
71,maintains a good temp all through the day and shows the temp so easy to double check if all going alright or not.Very easy to keep it clean with minimum amount of noise.very spacious and have enough space for everything we need to place in there.overall a product to match my need
72,Looking for the right model to fit our families needs and the space in our kitchen was a challenge but this little beauty was the right choice!!  The ice and water dispenser are easy and I love the doors and how easy it is to access the fridge and freezers.  Recommended
73,"Had this for 2 years now. It's great and reliable! My only gripe with the design is the thick door which has to protrude 100mm from the cabinet. Either that or make the cabinet 100mm wider. Having said that, almost all fridges of this type are designed this way nowadays. The 4th door cool select convertible is nice feature but always left it as ""freezer"", otherwise, there will be little space for a freezer with just one door. Also, I had to put one of those chair leg rubber pads on the water/ice dispenser levers to prevent it from being scratched."
74,"This is the best fridge I have ever bought, its quiet, it maintains its temperature in all compartments well and the water dispenser /  ice maker is amazing, it produces cubed or crushed ice its that easy to us my 3 year old daughter cant do it!!! Well done Samsung. very happy :)"
75,"Easy fix, air pocket forming in between drain tray and drain hose. TURN OFF POWER, SECOND STEP TURN OFF POWER. Remove all shelves from fridge section, remove evaporator cover, three screws in total, gently from top to bottom remove cover, flush hot water inside drain tray, use a 1/4 inch hose to blow down the hole until cleared, cut and small strip of metal 4cm X 0.5xm and wrap around heater and place into hole. Reverse steps....Next remove bottom back plate on fridge, remove hose to the right, and clean hose. And Wham bam, give yourself a high five. Your a genius.SincerelyFrustrated Samsung technician"
76,"So, we chose this fridge for it's configuration and ice and water dispenser. The bottom 2 compartments are freezer but the right bottom can be used as a fridge instead, which is how we use it. This works great as a ""drinks fridge"". We have been very happy with this fridge til recently when the ice maker stopped working, within 3 year of purchase. Apparently this is a common problem and it was fixed under extended warranty. With the fix in place though, it is now leaking (which we are getting around to being fixed) within the fridge from the water/ice dispenser. It is a minor leak but an inconvenience."
77,"I feel we are missing having a butter compartment, but that is minor. The crisper draws are difficult to pull apart in order to clean the debris that has gotten caught in crevices that I can't clean. I did try to watch a video on how to pull the draws apart in order to clean in the crevices, but alas, it was not easily done and I cracked the draw and so have not attempted this again."
78,"Like many stainless steel looking appliance, fingerprints on the trims and facade is a bit of an issue. But it does wipe down easily enough."
79,This is otherwise a great fridge that we are overall happy with.
80,"always has worked perfectly. such a convenience having the water dispenser! its so sleek and looks so nice especially with modern homes!! never had a problem with ours and is really easy to clean and maintain, doesn’t require a lot of time which is ideal for a big family! love this fridge"
81,It is great works well so far.  The ice and water in used by the whole family summer and winter.  We live in Qld and water is the drink of choose.  The ice machine does make a bit of noise but will put up with this as it just keeps on making ice.  Never had a problem cleaning it.  Works well
82,"Good spacious fridge, Down right side of the fridge can be used as freezer and can be converted to fridge. Classic look, Easy to maintain. Needs plumbing. very silent. only 2.5 star rating but consumes very less power.nice storage boxes for veg and non veg items in freezer.spacious  and four doors"

Lots of room inside for large items.Things i dont like:Water dispenser us very messy, water comes out too fast and hits the bottom of the glass and spills up the sides and out of the glass. Ice dispenser is also messy, it comes out of a wide outlet so therefore you need a wide rim glass.Loud ice machine when it dumps the ice."
85,AFTER 10 MONTHS THE FRIDGE HAD ISSUES.The fridge stopped cooling although the freezer still was working fine. The fridge was still under warranty so we had it repaired. The issue was a pipe with a leak and it was replaced. Hopefully no further issues.
86,This is a great fridge. So far haven't had an problems with it whatsoever. It is huge (in fact I think probably a little bit too big for our family) but does a great job at keeping everything cool evenly and my daughters really like the water function and so do I.
87,"The fridge has what I would classify as a severe design flaw which you should be aware of, you are welcome to ask Samsung or your retail store.If something spills onto the bottom shelf the liquid will go in between the glass on the bottom shelf. This is unable to be removed without significant drama. Don't be fooled with how easy it is on youtube videos - its not easy at all. Also liquid will go underneath the filter and again this is not easy to clean. It took a lot of effort and we broke one of the plastic tabs.It was an innocent mistake where we had a spillage in the fridge but the cleanup was very difficult. It should not be this difficult and were wondering how this ever got through QA processes.Also the water is not chilled. There is approx 500ml at most stored where the filter is at fridge temperature. What this means is that water will not be chilled for example if you use that 500ml and then want more straight away. It will just be normal tap temperature."
88,I went back to Harvey Norman and tried to return this fridge as the fact its nearly impossible to remove the bottom glass shelf is a severe design flaw and should not be tolerated.Unfortunately I am stuck with this fridge now as they wont accept the return. Very very disappointed and the darn thing is only 6 weeks old.
89,very good absolutely big - convenient  fridge to have.yes easy to clean too.the only problem is - ice maker makes very much frosty ice.(i am not exacting super clear ice from fridge)to be honest i did not like at all.i will find my way to make lil bit clear ice.lil bit noise when it makes ice. but its okay.. does not become too loud
90,"Sadly, like many others, we have been taken in by the cool sleek designs of Samsung products in recent years.Two widescreen TVs (around 10k spent) have failed and needed to be replaced with what we find out are common problems. Now an 18 month old fridge has developed a massive water buildup issue - which upon a brief Google search you find out is common with this Samsung product - multiple online YouTube videos showing what you have to do to plug the leak."
91,But why should you have to do that with a $3000+ electrical appliance only 18 months old. Can safely say - from our own experience - stay away from Samsung products - they might look the best but are not build to last for any reasonable length of time. We have found this out the hard way.
92,Will never purchase Samsung in any line of products again - never encountered such colossal failure in quality of goods in 30 years as a consumer.
93,"Yes it maintains the temperature, you can even adjust the temperature for hot food and this will freeze quicker, Water cooler at the front so you are not constantly opening the fridge all the time. No plumbing required either. In freezer section ice tray that empties into compartment so always ice cubes ready to go"
94,"Bought it a few days ago. Fridge temp is good, bottom left freezer is weak and takes a couple of hours to get back to minus 20 if you open even the fridge door above. The bottom right can't maintain better than about minus 10 to minus 12 so things aren't keeping especially ice cream...really runny. Spent a fortune on plumbing to connect it and after a couple of glasses the water is warm. Ice cubes seem ok. Arranging to swap for an LG. So disappointed as I loved the look of it but need a fridge that works properly. Easy to keep clean not too noisy."
95,If you have one of these don't trust the temp it reports on the display. Check each compartment with a temp probe. Check ice creams to confirm what's happening. Good luck with this one.
96,"I Love the ice dispenser and how easy it is to make your own drink on a hot summers day. This fridge is brilliant for storage spacing, enabling celery, cabbage, fruits and other large items to file away just nicely into the fridge. It is also a Wonderfully Compact Design!"
97,"Have had this fridge for nearly 2 years and still love it! Has a digital temperature display which maintains a constant temperature. It's quiet, easy to keep clean. We did have a little bit of trouble getting it through a standard doorway and we had to remove the screendoor and door knobs to get it through."
98,"Have had this fridge for nearly 2yrs and still love it!  Has a digital temperature display which maintains constant temperature.  Half of the freezer can be converted to fridge temperature if required so you have versatility.  Heaps of space, adaptable shelves for tall bottles, easy to access fridge drawers and organise - I love it!  Only minor 'con' is we have to replace the water filter every 6 months which is about $80 each time but worth it for the amount of water we go through (probably about 5L a day on average)!"
99,We've had this fridge about 6 weeks now and I'm really happy with it.   The layout of the shelving works really well for me.  I really like the flexibility of having the extra fridge/freezer compartment. At the moment we have only used it as a fridge as we don't buy a lot of frozen stuff.  Not having protruding handles is a really good feature as well. This is a large fridge and I would recommend just checking your access ways to get it in your home. We did have a little bit of trouble getting it through a standard doorway and we had to remove the screendoor and door knobs to get it through.
100,"My only complaint is closing the doors.  You can't just give them a little push as you walk away, there is resistance and they bounce back open, so you need to physically push them the whole way closed."
101,"Excellent choice. Purchased this refrigerator back in Dec 2017, It always maintains the set temperature and I had absolutely no trouble with this refrigerator in the last 14 months, only thing I had to do was replacing the filter cartridge within the 6 months. I would highly recommend this refrigerator to anyone based on my experience."
102,"I couldn't pull out my previous fridge with draws,I decide to bought this fridge because the doors were easy to open while I was pregnant.It's quite, easy to keep clean and organiseWhat I like most about this fridge is when I open the doors I can see everything, I like to open the fridge just to look at it and then close it.The Ice maker is cool, sometime jammed is it because I don't use ice often?"
103,"Not the loudest fridge, great ice machine. Maintains a crispy cool temperature all day long."
104,Filtered water could run a little faster does does have a good neutral taste.
105,"Ice never has that funny ""ice taste"" to it even when you don't empty the ice often."
106,Great looking fridge as well.
107,This fridge is great for country style living not excessive on power Great seals easy maintenance and access to all compartments it is a great fridge that is easily cleaned the shelving is perfect and the temperature controls in both the fridge side and freezer side are excellent all in all a great purchase
108,"I've had it for quite a while now and it has never failed me, I've never had any problems with it and always maintains it's selected temperature. I've been able to clean it a few times and it's a a bit of a hassle but that happens to all fridges I've had. And because it is right next to my bedroom and my walls are thin I still can't hear it!"
109,"its a very pretty fridge. i like the outside. its very quiet during the day. and you can't hear the noisy in the evening. i would strongly recommend this fridge. i went to shopping the food twice each week, and put all the friut and vegetable in it, it will maintain the fresh and works well."
110,"Very easy to clean and is very quiet, except when it's making ice it becomes loud for a little bit. We get lots of compliments because it's a really beautiful fridge. I love the french doors and it's quite big inside the fridge and freezer. I would highly recommend this."
111,"The buttom shelves are cooler than top shelf. The vegetables will be frozen by fresh size at some times, but the top compartments is not cold enough. The fridge is quiet, I can n't hear any noisy at night.This fridge is not easy clean, as the smell will keep inside and I have to use strong chemist to clean and then open door and reduce the smell. Also the compartments easy drop, it causes mess as well."
112,"The Samsung fridge is innovative, looks great and has functioned very well. As the title says, it does what its supposed to. However after a number of years of use, the ice dispenser has given way and no longer works. The water dispenser does work as per normal, however we now have to make our ice manually. Other than that, I have seen any other issues."
113,"I love this fridge but there are a couple of little things that could be improved. The filtered water has quite a slow flow. Our first filter was super bad and the flow did improve somewhat after replacing it but it is still slow. The door shelves in the bottom area are very narrow and are really of little use. Other than these two issues- this fridge looks good, provides the convenience of having ice and water, wide shelves for multiple plate/platter sizes and tall containers. It is super quiet and easy to wipe clean inside and out."
114,"Perfect fridge for the growing family, parties and all things in between."
115,"There are 3 separate compartments - one is a dedicated fridge, another is a dedicated freezer whilst the last can be either!"
116,Plenty of room in the fridge and along the doors and super easy to wipe down.
117,"The only negative I can think of is the water comes out with quite a bit of pressure. Once we got used to the pressure, it was a matter of strategically placing our cups but guests tend to leave their mark when getting water!"
118,Great fridge
119,purchased this about 2 months ago. very good fridge. great temp throughout. Some quirky ergonomics on opening but not a major issue. The freezer is also good. The water dispenser is a nice bonus but I find that the pressure could be a bit more. Again not a deal breaker.
120,"Maintains great and stable temperature, keeps all food and items fresh and cold. Easy to clean, quiet fridge.  Ice and water dispenser is nice, keeps it very cold and refreshing. Great fridge and looks amazing, however consumes a lot of electricity. Overall a versatile product that does all the things you want a refrigerator to do."
121,"it maintain a good temperature in all compartments;Is it quiet;It's easy to clean; but cost lots of electricity.Great temp throughout, very easy to clean. Very quiet fridge and the best part about it is the water and ice dispenser, great for hot days, would never go back to a fridge without a water dispenser, they're just so convenient."
122,"Great temp throughout, very easy to clean and you can take parts out to make it easier for you to clean.  Very quiet fridge and the best part about it is the water and ice dispenser, great for hot days, would never go back to a fridge without a water dispenser, they're just so convenient!"
123,"A nice one, which maintains good temperature harmony across all the compartments,keeping the contents fresh and lively.Easy to clean since the inside material is dust proof. Very quiet indeed as well."
124,Overall budjet friendly and recommend to anyone looking for purchasing a fridge that has all and does all.
125,"Very spacious and easy to clean. It maintains a good temperature in all compartments and I've never had a problem with noise. The water filter can be annoying to clean though and ours gets dirty quite easily (the filter). Other than this, great fridge that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a family of 4+ fridge."
126,"The main issue we have had with this refrigerator is that it doesn’t seem to maintain its temperature during those extreme Australia days. Where the water function will start the morning out rice cold, but by midday would be a more room temperature water. I also wouldn’t suggest side by side freezer, but instead look into a freezer drawer as you tend to fit more compared to this model."
127,This fridge is an excellent choice for a family.Plenty of space and multiple compartments for easy assortments.Latest facility and elegant look is an added bonus to it.Performance is way better then other fridges out in the market.If you are looking for a perfect gift to your house this fridge is undoubtedly perfect.Highly recommend this product.
128,The fridge effectively maintains the temperature in all compartments. However it is sometimes a little loud and can be a disturbance. It is quite easy to clean since the plastic shelves can be removed to be cleaned. Furthermore the fridge is quite good at its price point and the water dispenser is quite good.
129,"We purchased this fridge around 9 months ago. Overall it was easy to clean, lovey design (though we got the darker model)"
130,The controls give plenty of options around temperature settings and fridge health.
131,"Very quiet, noise was never an issue."
132,Plenty of room for a large family like ours (6)
133,"This fridge we got for our new home is amazing. My wife wanted a french door refrigerator. The thing I love about it that it has compartments for quick eats like the egg, dairy products or noodle in a wrapped bowl. The ice maker works great! loved it! The bottom part is for frozen products. The drawers and shelves are perfectly organised. The smart sensor works fine to control the temperature. Highly recommended!"
134,Nice and quiet. Easy to clean.fast ice maker. Lots of compartments.Maintains good temperature.Love this model.A bit expensive but once you get it you will love it.Worth the extra spent.Bought from harvey norman greens rd. Excellent service from staff at harvey norman.We are regular shopper at harvey norman.
135,Have been very happy with this fridge up until this week when the ice maker stopped making ice. I took the ice bucket out and the while internal ice maker was frozen over. Not what I expect from a $3000 fridge freezer. Samsung can you come and fix please asap? Thanks
136,Really good refrigerator  i bought ever too much space in this specially good for big families easy to clean good water dispenser kids love it very big space in freezer as well two different boxes in freeezer makes easy work but different kind of stuff separately stainless steel so good for cleaning.
137,"we thought that buying the most expensive fridge so far in our lives was pretty dumb but we have had it for 2 months and so far  its the best fridge we have ever owned, water and ice is fantastic , it makes noise when it puts ice somewhere inside itself but that's not a problem at all."
138,We had purchased a Samsung prior to this 14 years ago and it is still going strong. However with 4 children and 14 grandchildren decided we needed another fridge as well. This too is a great quality fridge and love the fact that one section can be changed into a fridge or freezer depending on your needs. Almost no noise for such a big fridge. Look forward to using it for many years to come!
139,"Really great fridge unit with the convenience of ice. Temperature control is spot on. The stainless steel finish which is what we went for is really stylish, really really easy to clean those finger prints on the doors. The inside is spacious and has plenty of shelving. What a unit!"
140,Fantastic quality and very appealing to look at. It has a very modern look and is slick. Love the features that come with it and is easy to clean. Hopefully this fridge will last me a long time for the years to come. Definitely happy with my purchase and I have recommended this product to numerous friends and families.
141,"Looked around for a while. Really only 2 Fridges on the market with Ice & Water. Samsung, LG and Bosch/Electrolux. Ended up with the Samsung as you can change the bottom right section into a Cool section, Fridge or Freezer. Lighting is very nice in all 3 sections. It has door alarms but don't work on Freezer sections?? No problems so far and is very quiet to old Bosch Fridge. Bought it from The Good Guys, on sale for $2850.00 delivered."
142,Not very loud. Easy to clean. Every now and then it lets out a loud type of electrical noise but otherwise it's fine. Lots of storage space. First Samsung fridge had a few issues and was eventually replaced with this one but so far so good. We like Samsung appliances :)
143,The unit is really swish looking.
144,It run quietly and fits the bill.  However I find some of the crisper units difficult to take out to clean.  The vegetable compartment has a ridge at the bottom that catches every tiny spec of vegetable matter and it sits there and go brown. I have resorted to removing it and hosing it out which does the trick but is a pain.
145,"The temperature setting display broke within the first couple of months and Samsung had someone on the job in no time, no trouble."
146,It could be brighter inside and could also use an alarm if you don't close the freezer properly.  Another handy addition would be a setting that allow the door to close by itself (so you could dial the close pressure) - that way you can't possibly leave it open.
147,Overall is lovely just a few bits and pieces would make it great.
148,Yes simple parts to keep clean temp goes up and down to inform u of food spoilage possibility enough space to make it practical this fridge can keep tall and small itmes and door items cold water cooler easy clean this is by far the best fridge on power and practicality i have owned
149,This fridge is great can ajust fridge temp and freezer temp. One side of freezer can be changed to fridge temp for extra fridge storage. Having cold water available all the time with cubed or crushed ice is great for my family. The fridge is very quiet and very easy to wipe over. Shelves lift up for bottles if extra space required.
150,"The fridge freezer is a great product i have no complaints at all about this fridge freezer, it is so quiet i never hear anything from the motor. It keeps things so cold in the fridge compartment and the freezer part is so big. It is ideal for any size family."
151,"We purchased our fridge two years back and it worked like a dream. One night, however, we woke to it making weird sounds and all out food had gone hot. We called up Samsung repair Group in our local area to have it fixed and we were informed that this particular problem happened way to much and was endless work for him - basically he told us to never get another one. But we bit the bullet ,had it repaired and now it's working a dream again but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy another Samsung in the future"
152,This has great use of space and very robust and enjoyable feel to it- it feels nice to open and use. Very comfortable and user friendly too. Very easy to clean. Perfect for medium sized families and good for storing all foods in an easily accessible way while keeping everything well laid out.
153,"Maintains good temperature, is very quiet unless making ice in the ice dispenser, then it makes a very slight popping noise but it is not very noticeable. Plenty of storage space so have not run out of shelves or made any spills yet. very easy to keep clean. The freezer is very spacious and i love the second shelf that pulls out when the door is opened. My favourite part is the water and ice dispenser, so easy to use even my mother-in-law who doesn't speak English much less know how to work technology, figured it out on the first go."
154,"The Samsung has good constant temperature throughout all shelves. The options wither water, ice cubes or crushed ice is what put this fridge over the line for us. It is easy to clean and the water filter is easy to replace. It is quiet and easy to adjust temperature settings in both fridge and freezer."
155,It's a very economical refrigerator also it runs very quitley and very easy to clean and I love ❤️ the ice block tray it's perfect you twist and turn and out come the ice blocks. And because I'm living in a unit at the moment it's a perfect fit and I'm amazed at how much it actually holds because it's small and streamlined looking because of this it's deciving it holds much more than you would imagine
156,"We purchased this to replace our 10 year old LG sidebyside fridge freezer.  The wife liked the fact you could setup the bottom right side as a fridge.  It cools and does its job, however there are some issues."
157,"Compressor is noisy.  Could not hear our old LG, while this Samsung hums and buzzes so loud that it can be heard over the TV. Samsung claim this is normal."
158,ICE maker technology - It uses technology to freeze the ice rapidly due to the small size of the ice maker.  This results in white ice full of air bubbles.  This ice instantly sends a fizzy drink flat. The excess air trapped in the ice foams up the fizzy drink and leaves it flat - Old LG with conventional Ice maker didn't have this issue. Samsung advise that this is normal and by design.
159,"Doors closing - Doors don't close automatically, due to the design they need to be manually closed with a forced clunk - this results in all the bottles/items on the door shelves clunking and falling over."
160,"This fridge looks great in my Kitchen and does cool drinks and food, however all other aspects of it are cheap and nasty.  Given the cost, there are much better options out there.  I will look at returning ours If possible."
161,Terrible - Stay away.
162,We love the fridge - it’s spacious and functional spaces to put food. We bought this as our fridge space is facing the corner of benchtop in a small confined area. No door handles fits perfectly in our kitchen design.
163,The digital screen is easy to use and two options for ice is great for summer preparing drinks for guests.
164,"This fridge and freezer is Easy to set up and operate, it's very quiet and Samsung have really good customer service when you need help. Lots of space. Ice maker is a great function and you have the choice of crushed or cubed. we did have an issue with the bottom container in side of fridge, but they sent out a replacement for free"
165,"Positives+Great fridge, water filter unlike many really easy to installed.+Great layout inside with simple sliding to allow big bottles etc.+about to turn bottom right into anything from a cool box to fridge or freezer and in-between, Good for those wanting a beer fridge or FISH fridge."
166,"negatives,-ICE takes a long time to fall into your glass, even longer if crushed.-People press and hold the button to select crushed and cubed and this reset the timer on the filter, if you lock -this feature then NOTHING workings, very annoying and reset all the time."
167,Love this Fridge!! It stays super cold.One slight problem is my vegetables always get frozen but when i turn the Fridge temperature up then my other items in the fridge are not cold enough for my liking.I think the only thing needed is better ventilation in the vegetable Crisper.
168,"Love this fridge as it’s really easy to clean. It’s so quiet the only noise is when the ice is reproducing. The water is at a great temperature and you have a choice on what is you want, whether it be crushed or not. My food always maintains fantastically fresh. I just love it"
169,"We have had our fridge now for a couple of months now. I can honestly say this is the best fridge we have ever had. Very quite, keeps great temperature and plenty of space, in particular the freezer compartment. Very well designed, looks great and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this fridge to my family and friends. The only fault I could pick (and it is very minor) is the ice is a little small and sometimes provides slightly crushed ice on cube setting. Other than that, do yourself a favour and get this fridge. You will never look back."
170,"When i first got this fridge i noticed the freezer wasnt getting cold enough even though temp was all the way down, the company was really helpful and had it fixed within 24 hours, i love everything about it, i find it easy to clean a quick spray with vinegar and a wipe and done"
171,My in laws have this product and oh my it is a fantastic refrigerator. Create a lovely space looks great in their kitchen I cannot wait to purchase this item for my house. It's remarkable and quality sound which is what I personally look for in a product and it's great
172,Great space in both fridge and freezer. Ice maker is nice and quiet. Only criticism is that fingerprints show in door which is time consuming to clean all the time.. water function has high pressure so water sometimes spills out because it comes out too fast. I need to look into if there is an adjustment of speed. Thanks
173,"My family like it. Easy to clean .good temperature and easy to control with touchscreen,no need to open for water and ice, if you need crushed ice easy press the crush ice . If you want more space , convert freezer Into fridge .if you want quick freeze things set temperature ."
174,"Very happy with the fridge so far! The Temperature is even all over, in door  compartment is very helpful so we are not constantly opening the fridge! The bottom draws seperate for fruit and vegetables are also very handy! Freezer setting is good even with the ice compartment in there it dsnt seem smaller"
175,"We choose this fridge for the size, and the look. I don't really like the look of the chunky handles. I feel they take the overall look of the fridge.Really impressed with the space in the fridge although did miss my draw for dairy. Fixed that by buying a fridge container from Kmart to store cheese and dips. I was dubious about the space In the freezer as well but , it holds more than I every expected. really happy.It also has one side of the freezer that you can change to fridge space if you need. I might try that for Xmas.The inside is easy to wipe clean , and the outside finish is the same. Just wipe with warm water pass the tea towel over and sparkling clean. Mind you, my husband did use a spray to clean it , not good idea it was smeary. Stick to water.Keeps great temperature and is very quiet.Very happy with our purchase. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star I do give it 4 1/2 is because the ice container is smaller than our last fridge and the ice cubes are a little different. But getting used to that so all good."
176,"Pros - looks great, water and ice built in with lights, huge capacity. Great drawers in freezer, crisper drawers are great. Easy to clean. Strong metal shelving. One section of freezer can be converted to fridge. Great quality stainless steel finishCons - hefty price tag, when closing doors you need to push hard or they swing back open. doors were slightly crooked when delivered, service tech came out and fixed right away. My sister purchased the same one and had the same issue. Again they fixed it right away and replaced the entire door. Very happy with Samsung."
177,"We have had this fridge since December last year and it is great. The shelves on the top compartment are wide to fit extra wide stuff, there's even a collapsible shelf if you need to keep a bottle or tall container and it won't fit in the door, there's plenty of freezer space and you can always convert the 4th section between freezer and fridge as required, the LED lighting is also pretty nice. I've had no issues whatsoever with it since we got it. All in all, a great purchase"
178,"Yes, quite, good value for money. Always, easy to install, bought silver, good deals around Boxing Day of Christmas Day. Bought few things together so got good deal. So far it's working good. Work good !! All family members have same this brand. Ask for deal wife you buy and enjoy."
179,I've purchased the fridge since april and so far it does maintain good temperature in all compartments and it's very quiet and easy to clean . Easy to use and convenient . And it's safe the electricity as well which is good. I would recommend this one to use .
180,"Very quickly cooled down after instillation and can't believe how quiet it is, love the layout and the space and being able to turn the bottom right hand freezer into a fridge is what sold it to me, yes the ice maker is noisy when it drops the ice into the bucket but I expect the noise to decrease as the bucket fills up if the fridge itself is anything to go by. Very happy with this product and very pleased that I decided not to go for another make. The $300 cash back is another bonus"
181,Great temperature all round and a freezer side that can be set to a fridge to. As we drink a lot of water it seems the filter needs to be changed regularly and is a bit costly. Ice maker and water compartmemt don't take as much space. Downfall on the fridge is the depth wich is wider than most fridges .
182,"Very happy with this product, space is great and can hardly hear the noise. Ice maker can some times make bit noise but it's not too bad. Over all it's a great product and I will definitely recommend. Electricity bill was my concern but it's still under control. Having fridge in the bottom some times an issue if u have little kids who you want to keep away from ice cream otherwise we loved it."
183,"I love our new fridge - it's simply stunning. It is very practical. I love that both fridge doors open to allow you to put in wide items - cakes, platters etc. The water is chilled and the ice is super hard! The best feature for me is the fact that you can change one of the freezer doors into a refrigerator which is perfect for entertaining and it also means that there is no wasted space! We were lucky to buy the fridge while there was a $400 cashback promotion."
184,It's very easy to clean. It's good for a family of 5 it fit's a lot. Has 2 draws one for the vegetables and one for the fruit. We had Samsung for 5 years and we also like the water filter with ice and the drinking water it's good for all the year especially the summer time. The filter last's 6 month's which is good we don't keep changing it just twice a year.
185,When measuring fridge spaceCheck where computer is.We had to remove above cupboard as computer height was not in measurdments advertised by samsungIce maker fabulousPleanty of roomKeeps temperature beautifullyCharming feature in our kitchenPlenty of room for the family requirementsFreezer compartment has great accessible doors
186,"Not only does this fridge look amazing it also runs extremely well. It maintains a perfect temperature throughout, is so easy to clean and is also very quiet! There's so much space, you'd never have a problem fitting in & I love that there is so much storage. Very happy with this purchase."
187,It's OKIt keeps food clean does it or keep it cold. I actually have another fridge so i don't know OMG
188,y a s
189,I don't think there are that high expectations for a fridge however. Some fridges Ive had have made annoying noises so yeah
190,"This is the best fridge I have purchasedThe ice machine is able to keep up with demandWater is nice and coldFood alway maintained at good temp as the freezerVery easy to install I did on my own no man help lolYou can have no ice, crushed ice and cubesNice and quiet though when dropping ice it can make u jump at 1st haha"
191,This fridge is huge and spacious.  It is remarkably quiet and even the beeping when the door is open for too long is mild and stops after about 30 seconds instead of being continuous.   It show not show finger prints which is a bonus feature with kids! The double freezer at the bottom is fabulous.  Lighting is also good so it is easy to see at night.  Highly recommend.
