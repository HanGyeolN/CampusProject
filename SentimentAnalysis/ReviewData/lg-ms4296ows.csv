0,Bought this microwave during goodguys ebay sale. Great machine. When finished cooking music is played instead of a ding sound. But easy to leave finger print on the control panel. Because it is piano black
1,Programming and controls are well designed and intuitive to use. Absolutely love the minimalist and sleek look. The cute tunes and noises are not too loud of offensive either. 10/10
2,"This is a great microwave, it's looks are minimalistic, and it cooks really well. However, the controls are downright stupid. I suggest it has been designed by someone who has never used a microwave oven, or has never actually used this one. It is impossible to select 45 seconds to cook (or anything that ends in a 5). The minimum time selection is 10 seconds, and multiples thereof. Too bad if 40 seconds isn't quite enough, but 50 seconds is too much. Yes, you can stop it manually at 45 seconds, but really? When I bought this one, I didn't really know what to expect - I had read the reviews and thought I could get used to it. However, I find the controls so irritating, that if I had my time again, I would have bought one with conventional controls. As I said, it performs flawlessly as a microwave oven, but the controls are simply ridiculous."
3,"We had a Smeg and I thought I’d was good. But it only lasted a couple of years. I actually came into product review to choose this LG. The ratings were high and the price from good guys was great. So we decided to give it a go. This oven has the inverter defrost and that is excellent. No more cooked edges with frozen centres on defrost. The ability to use the simple glass controls with the door close or the more detailed keypad with the door opened is handy. The oven is powerful with 1200 watts. The only thing I don’t like is the annoying tune it plays when it’s finished. The rest of our devices are pretty much  Miele but they don’t make microwaves really which is a shame because I have never had any Miele device die, but this oven holds its own against its German siblings. So both thumbs up so far."
4,"Great little microwave, so much better then the one i replaced it with! works well, easy to use and so quiet! Con is it shows fingerprints easily so i have to wipe it regularly"
5,"I bought LG 42L MS4296OBS microwave oven from the Harvey Norman (HN) in Liverpool, NSW on 13th December 2019, on 27th February 2019 it stopped working. It shows all display correctly but does not heat food."
6,"I read couple of similar negative reviews before buying this; thinking those people are unfortunately unlucky ones, to my surprise I became one of them. I called HN store next morning and to add in my surprise they said I have to return it to the store, they will then send it to LG. It will take at least 7-10 days before we will know any kind of outcome. During this time of ""assessment"" I will not have any replacement from the store or from the LG, and have to live without microwave for at least 7-10 days. It is simply unacceptable. I was under the impression that I will get refund or exchange of microwave oven if I go to store. Apparently LG require store to send all faulty products back for assessment while their customer have to wait.  I had K-mart $50 microwave previously worked perfectly fine for >10 years. We gave it away for free when we got this new shiny microwave. Now thinking it was mistake. I can’t believe LG will let customer wait for the answers till they “assess” the produce for fault. I don’t know how this even makes sense economically for LG (considering cost of transportation, repairs, and faulty parts)? Also it does not make sense for their customers to suffer for LG's faulty product? I was told by the HN store that Panasonic have different policy, store can simply replace faulty microwave with the new one on spot. At least I know which oven I will get/refer next."
7,"Apart from above fault, we did not like the glass panel in front. It looks good but not very practical. You will see tones of fingerprints by the end of day."
8,After 7 days of no contact from LG or HN store I contacted LG service centre. I was told they don’t know which third party service centre has my oven. I then contacted HN store and got the details of third party service centre. I called them and they informed me that my oven is repaired (they have changed PCB and magnetron) and I can “collect” it anytime. I asked them to send it to store instead. I then collected it from the store.
9,"This was a big inconvenience and time consuming process, considering I have to live without oven for >7 days, carry this heavy oven to store and collect it back.  I am not sure if Australian consumer law have any protection for this kind of situation. I now essentially have refurbish microwave oven."
10,The design and colour is very sleek and modern. It heats the food evenly and has good power. Very minimalistic design which I love. It's also very quiet which is a plus. Definitely recommend
11,"Needed a new microwave so we brought this one. Great so far. Heats up real quick, kids love the sounds it makes. When you are busy, the sounds don't let you forget there's something in it. We have brought an LG fridge so this matches perfect!"
12,Its simple and elegant looking with flush flat face that is easy to clean.Most importantly it cooks and reheats food EVENLY. Love the defrosting function that actually thawls throughout. Only con is the tune it plays when it ends.
13,Have had this microwave for nearly 2 years and have had no issues. Cooks well and is easy to operate and clean. Looks very good in the kitchen. Grandchildren like the tune it makes when finished though i can take it or leave it.  Sliding controls work well. When finished it has a fan cooling down cycle which should help in increasing its life.
14,Two years and four days after purchase it died. It worked except that it plays a tune when finished and this does get tiresome - what is wrong with a couple of subtle beeps. At a change in time you have to turn the unit off and back on to set the new time - twice a year and when mounted in a cabinet it can be awkward. You can only set in 10 second increments - a common problem with models now. The selection of auto mode requires looking at a table - after a while you get to know to set to 3 for auto cooking vegetables. The display does not assist in selecting modes. The opening and closing the door often causes the whole microwave to slide around. Sometimes the touch sensitive buttons do not work - a problem when you need it to stop in a hurry - you end up opening the door to stop the microwave. To access most of the functions you have to open the door. It does show fingerprints and needs to be wiped often - sometimes triggering the touch buttons. Have now bought a 44L panasonic - so much better - simple beeps - can set the time - we will see how it goes.
15,"Been using this microwave for 15 months now, and I wouldn't be without it. I especially love the sensor feature. It works brilliantly for fresh veggies, and cooks rice perfectly."
16,"A microwave is a microwave. It performs all the task that it is supposed to, but it looks absolutely beautiful. All ugly buttons hidden, very sleek as there is only one door that goes from edge to edge (L to R). All features behind the door are the ones rarely used, so its a great place for it to be. All the everyday used buttons are easily accessed in the front."
17,"I agree closely with Truebleu2 comments.The programming for defrosting and heating using programs seem to miss the point and prove variable. I weighed up some frozen chicken, defrosted it and was suspicious so I only allowed it to do 2/3 of the time shown. Just as well as this was virtually defrosted and slightly cooked on edges. I returned to practices used with my old Sharp (10 years old). This means I manually defrosted food on reduced times and gave timed breaks before resetting the time expected to complete the defrosting. I also calculated that P70-80 was close to the power input of my old Sharp which was 950watts.I tried something simple, heating baked beans. The programming based on weight was again over zealous. I returned to manual heating. I will next check the machine for hot spots and overall heat distribution before providing another review. My machine is only 1 month old so I will include reliability in my next review too.The machine is tidy and very easy to operate. I just hope the programming buttons don’t fail with time given I don’t trust the auto cook timings so manual touch buttons may get overused."
18,This microwave stopped heating after 12 months. To explain my issue via chat was a nightmare. The LG service centers are inconvenient to get to and only open Monday to Friday. Not really great if you work. Lets hope I don't wait too long for my microwave to be repaired. I hope it lasts longer than 12 months this time! Give me my Panasonic back any day!
19,"I gave this  Microwave 3 start based i in fact it is a great MW when it works  quite, quick and efficient"
20,"Bought  10th Oct  2018, however  last night while reheating some rice, I heard a loud snap or crack come from it and then a really bad smell*  that was all she wrote  :(  no longer heats anything"
21,"The LG NeoChef microwave is simple, streamlined and beautiful. The door is soft closing, recessed and there is an easy to use swipe timer. The detailed cooking options are on the inside giving it a clean appearance on the outside. The white LED light gives it a nice illumination as well."
22,"Where do I start with this piece of work. Amazing! Really cool and easy for me to heat up my food! Although, not sure about the other button when you open it up it’s actually a touch microwave when you close it and just a quick min to heat up you food. Doesn’t make too much noise as well!"
23,"My general impression of the product agrees with most of the positive reviews I have read, so I won't repeat those impressions. However I would like to draw attention to an issue that does not appear to be addressed in the owner's manual.Pages 8 and 9 of the manual deal with setting up the microwave, culminating in a simple test of heating up 300ml of water for 30sec. If this works you are told that now all is OK. In my case the water heated but the turntable did not move as I expected based on my how my old microwave worked. As the manual did not mention anything about turntable rotation I thought perhaps on this new higher tech machine rotation depended on what settings were in place, and that rotation would occur on longer times and/or lower power settings. But whatever settings I tried, there was no rotation.  I concluded the oven was faulty and contacted LG customer care (available 7 days a week - excellent). The helpful consultant agreed there was something wrong and told me where I could take the oven for repair but also advised that I could try for a replacement at place of purchase.JB HI-FI were excellent and replaced the microwave with no hesitation, despite my having already destroyed all the packaging. The new machine appears to work correctly, with turntable always rotating when heating is in progress."
24,"Should anyone from LG happen to read this, may I suggest that the first two sentences of step 7 of the ""Unpacking & Installing"" section of the manual should read:The DISPLAY will count down from 30 seconds while the tray rotates.When the display reaches 0 it will chime briefly."
25,"I bought this in September 2018 to replace an old Sharp.My first impressions were how clean, stylish and modern it looked.The swipe feature at the front is easy to master and a nice touch.The hidden functions behind the door is also a nice touch and now after using the oven I can see why they hid them.Simply this micro wave is flawed like so many others because their programs just don't work as well as they should.i tried the defrost , weighed the meat, looked at the cook time and knew straight away this would cook the meat and sure enough that is what happened.Next I tried cooking rice in the special menu section, and once again the times were way too long and the rice .came our like a piece of rubber, the rice also boiled over into the microwave once again showing that the presets are wrong.If you want to cook rice do it by trial and error using the manual cook or just buy yourself a cheap rice cooker  it will do a better job.I can recommend the use of a microwave, any microwave that I have ever owned for one thing,and that is to reheat food the rest is just for show."
26,"The product looks beautiful, functions are easy to use, food is cooked evenly every time. Interior is easy to clean, the 42L model is the perfect size where as the 23L is a little small in my opinion. This microwave does its job well, purchased from Good Guys, would have loved this in stainless steel black but was not available at the time."
27,It’s been a pretty good microwave. Heats and defrosts as it should. The inner plate is a bit wobbly and the start button can be a bit touchy sometimes - you have to really make sure you finger is over it properly. But it’s a stylish design and in terms of its heating I have been impressed.
28,"Bought this around 8 months ago. We decided to get one without a turn table and boy did it make our lives easier. The cleaning process of this microwave is so easy, we just wipe the sides and flatbed.This microwaves is also very strong and can heat up food very quickly. There is a cooling mode which automatically switches on when the microwave gets to hot after using it. However the noise is a bit loud.The exterior design is sleek and minimalist. Buttons are easy to press and instructions are quite clear.Overall very satisfied with this purchase!"
29,Best microwave I have ever bought so easy to use I used a sensor cooking to cook potatoes and when it stopped they were perfect I love the little tune it plays when it is finished. very good price I can highly recommend this microwave easy to clean looks great too
30,"Excellent quality - heats things FAST! Sometimes we have to reduce microwave time shorter than heating instructions because this microwave is so powerful. Also looks really nice and is easy to use. The one odd thing (could be viewed as good or bad) is that the time display does not stay on. After a period of time the display turns off and you have to hit a button to get it to turn on. This is only a downside for us because it's the only clock in the kitchen, but it's not a big deal and doesn't take away from the quality for us."
31,We recently purchased this LG microwave in Black. It’s sleek and stylish front is black glass and looks great in our kitchen. Easy to use with the quick timer on the touch pad on the front. When you open the door there is another touch pad for a lot more options. Would recommend this product.1200w power.
32,"I’ve owned three microwaves and this is by far the best one I’ve ever owned. I love the sleek look; with no buttons but more of a touch pad. I also love how the main controls are in inside the unit door. Internally the microwave is super easy to clean; it appears to be a non stick, you just wipe it down. The microwave heats food evenly and quickly. The defrost function defrosts meat just right; with no dry cooked edges. Overall a great unit!"
33,I had been searching for a good microwave for quite some time. I was surprised at how cheap some of the ones on the market look and wanted something sleek that would blend in with my new kitchen. This was the perfect choice!
34,I really don't have anything negative to say about this microwave. I'd highly recommend it!
35,"Very minimalistic, yet functions smoothly and perfectly. Easy to use ! Someone who is looking for a fast and a microwave that does the job, definitely look into this NEOCHEF! 9/10. Needs some improvement, but nothing is perfect ... It warms and cooks everything to perfection and opens and closes very easily"
36,The food is heated efficiently and quickly with a nice even heat throughout the meal the texter is great and when I need a quick feed on the run it’s great and efficient and makes life easy sometimes especially when I’m busy so buy one and enjoy the benefits for sure
37,As there are only 2 of us now and we needed a new Microwave for our newly refurbished kitchen. It cooks everything to perfection as is easy to use. We needed a Microwave that opened out to the left and this was the only one that did. Pleased so far with this purchase.
38,"I'm normally a microwave skeptic. Patchy reheating, half-cooked meat when defrosting.. basically a pretty average experience and I mostly used it to melt butter, reheat leftovers and heat up wheat packs."
39,"I'm pretty much converted to using this thing all the time. If you use its smart settings, it actually does a really great job. Cooks fresh veggies well, defrosts without half cooking meat, reheats without destroying the texture of everything. The keep warm function is excellent and really handy too. And finally, a microwave door you can open and close without waking up the baby! It's easy to clean, too. I like the feature of opening the whole front of the unit and concealing most of the buttons."
40,"I could do without the little jingles it plays at the end, while defrosting, and those regular reminders when it's finished (I'm not likely to forget I put something in there for 2 minutes!). But ultimately at least it's a cheerful tune and even though we all end up whistling it randomly, it's much quieter than our old microwave and far less annoying. It would be excellent to have the option to mute it."
41,"If you're trying to decide whether to get this one, go for it. I doubt you'll regret it."
42,This microwave is by far the easiest one to use on the market. It’s so simple and with such a sleek design it’s the best. I’ve had this microwave for a couple of years now and nothing has broken or stopped working over the time that I have had it.
43,This replaced a very old microwave of the same capacity. What we first noticed was the smaller footprint. We were then pleasantly surprised by the many functions and found the sensor so easy and convenient to cook and reheat. The noise was not a problem because our old model was much worse. 24 Month warranty is a bonus that competitors were not offering. The instruction book is comprehensive and easy to read. The interior is well lit when in use. I found the touch pad on the door a little small and needed to train myself to find the right spot but this is a minor inconvenience. I did my research first and am very pleased with this buy. We wanted the Black model but got the SS for the same price when Black was unavailable. It looks good and is the same except for the exterior.
44,Great easy to use sleek design great product highly recommend works well and fast       The self cleaning function is amazing  it would be awesome if u could see the food cooking through the glass or if the glass could be removed to clean it  doesn’t use much power  and it’s perfect
45,"l bought this microwave last year from kmart as it was on sale. it works all well with no dramas at all. couldn't be happier with it so far. it is reasonably quiet and work efficiently, it heats foods evenly hot and it is very easy to clean. it is also very stylish with its whole body in black."
46,"Bought this at Harvey Norman, bit pricy but everyone who has been over at our place has mentioned that it looks pretty nice, works well and size is good too. Latest technology, heats food evenly, fast heating as it's powerful. Buttons are easy to operate and safe around kids too."
47,Just for new dark cabinet finishings in our renovated kitchen pack and our silver standard microwave just didn't match so went to Kmart and bought this as it was on sale. It heats the food up like it should and is super easy to clean out of it gets messy
48,"very quiet and the heat was very reliable as the temperature was very accurate. I said this because the previous microwave we had was really horrible and it would make loud noises. This one is also very environmental, no waste on electricity. the price was really good too. highly Recommended!"
49,"I'm using this advanced design LG microwave for over 5 months for now, couldn't be happier! This is the best microwave I have ever own. It warms up the food evenly, not like other ones that leave the core of dish cold and the edges are boiling! Also, it has a pleasant alarm (music) rather than annoying beeping!"
50,"It has all the Features I need Like  Different Country Meals Settings E G Australia,Italian, Middle Eastern and French  It Cooks Fast the Meals are Perfect when Cooked in my L G NeoChefit has a child lock ,you can grill in it  you can even steam cook  all vegetables"
51,"This microwave is powerful and quickly heats the food. It doesn't make to much noise and is reasonably quiet. It is easy to use, and the buttons are very easy to press.Has to separate control panels: the external one is very simple with basic functions and the internal one with more options.It has a good look and we like its nice and simple appearance.It is also easy to clean.It's been a few weeks we are using it and haven't noticed any issues."
52,"I have never bought LG machines in past and bought washing machine, fridge and microwave when I moved into my new house. Highly satisfied with all machines really. Microwave in particular is very quiet, warms up to the centre of the container (the centre can remain cold with other machines), very easy to clean and very energy efficient machine. Well worth the money."
53,"Love my new microwave, its modern looking with a sleek design. 42l perfect for families. Inverter Defrosts meat perfectly, no cooked edges. Just add the weight for defrosting and cooking and the machine works its magic.  It even plays music at the end (instead of the boring beep).  Works faster than my previous machines. Highly recommend"
54,"let me start this review off with the smooth look finish this lg microwave has that LG are renowned for the beautiful sleek edges its amazing, the features of this microwave are endless from melt to defrost and yes thats by weight too ! it has a converter which means it heats everything up as evenly as possible it really is smooth sailing with this microwave!"
55,"This style seems perfect for me. I brought it 1 month ago, which seemed all good! Works pretty fast and I love how quiet it is compared to my earlier Panasonic one. The fact I can adjust the heating temperature without having to open the door is really handy too."
56,"Although the size is a little big, it's really good for heating. Works pretty fast and I love how quiet it is compared to my earlier Panasonic one. It's spacious and love the light - not the dull yellow ones the previous machines were using.  The fact I can adjust the heating temperature without having to open the door is really handy too."
57,I have experienced no issues with this product however i cannot find any features which would make me look towards buying this microwave again. My food heats up as expected however it could be more powerful.the stainless exterior also scratches easily showing wear and tear earlier than I expected.
58,Pretty happy with it and easy to decrease and increase the time using swaping motion with a finger.. Defrosts very well and the melody is a bonus rather than the traditional beeping sound that used to make me press stop button quickly before the time is done as it used to wake my babies up. Sometimes food doesn’t get hot enough as quickly but happy with what I paid for.
59,Perfect; best microwave I've ever had.Used every day in my house and it never fails us at all.I love the professional look and it does not take up much space at all which is very handy when you have kids every where ha ha ha ha ha ha
60,"The unit is very attractive and by the feedback is likely just about the best out there, that is why we have bought it. In fact we have bought two (2). The first one had an issue immediately in as much as it would not let me enter the weight of the food in the Sensor function. I took the unit back to Harvey Norman (HN) and they replaced it immediately. The second unit was set up and had exactly the same problem. Rang HN and they chased the LG rep, in the meanwhile I rang LG customer service who said to take it back to the retailer and get another one, I explained this was a repeat issue and they eventually referred me to some LG service agent locally whom I rang and was informed they only do white-goods! HN called back and said they would refund or replace with another brand if I wished, can't fault the people at HN.Does anyone else experienced this issue, or have all of you with this unit tried the Sensor unit? If not, please do and let me know if there is a problem as this may be a manufacturing fault.NEW: Have just spoken to the ""Troubleshooting Team"" at LG who advise that a weight for the Sensor cook function is not required. The weight is required on the smaller MS259 unit. So all is well but I am still amazed that this machine can actually sense the amount of food that needs to be cooked. Thank you David for your advice as well. I have reviewed my rating in light of this knowledge. I have also suggested that the instruction be more specific on this issue with the MS429."
61,"Highly recommend microwave from lg, very easy to use, look is excellent, with modern technology, never make any noise just the normal noise or sound , the food heats up so quickly, been using this for over the year now never had any problems or issues, very satisfied with this product,"
62,"Hi, we purchased this smart inverter LG Microwave (Even and Fast cooking), we are so glad we did this, it heats evenly, has digital buttons / settings. Our old microwave would not heat evenly. This is great product with great price. I would recommend this to anyone. Has great shiny aesthetic looks."
63,I am currently loving using this product just bought less than a week ago and heats all my foods amazingly and the plays a cute song to tell me it’s ready. Not a huge microwave user but it really makes my kitchen look great. No unless knobs or keypads. It touch pad senses great and the 42 litres is perfect for bigger plates or keeping food warm while waiting for it to be served.
64,This is the greatest microwave ever has alot of features food cook or re heated perfect i love it cant see my life before having this i cant  live with out it and easy to clean stainless steal its great my life is heaps easy now thanks to this microwave
65,"This is a stylish-looking unit, with a large capacity (42 l) for its external size.  It cooks and reheats evenly, with the sensor cook feature so far working well for rice in particular.  The placement of the main controls inside the door is novel and takes a bit of getting used to, although the layout and operation is fairly logical.  The touch keys are responsive and the display bright and easily read."
66,The microwave is quiet when running and the LED light bright enough to see clearly what is going on.  The turntable is stable and not as heavy as my previous 20-year old microwave.
67,Very happy so far.
68,Update (September 2018): Still working very well and no change to my review above.
69,"Highly satisfied with the cooking results. At last change from sharp to LG. Setting and features easy to use. Love the sound when its ready. Sturdy and well built. Fit the avent steriliser, fit my square plate well. I can add multiple dish at the same time and all heat evenly. Space efficient for my family. Love everything about it!"
70,I love our new microwave.  It is sturdy and well built.  It is easy to keep clean.  I love the hidden buttons so it looks great on the kitchen bench top.  The food cooks really fast and plays a fun tune when its done.  While cooking the microwave is quiet. Ive wasted so much money on cheap microwaves I saw this one and it's a brand I trust and also its sturdy nature made me decide. Definitely worth the money.. really happy with this microwave.
71,My wife and I we needed a new microwave we were looking everywhere for a perfect microwave but we couldn’t find few months ago we bought this product and we are very happy with it this microwave is fast in heating and being stainless steel is unbelievable and I did not mention perfect size and love it.
72,"bought this microwave at my good friends at Domayne, and after 2 weeks, microwave failed to heat. microwave vegetables were on for 20 minutes at still frozen. returned to store and swapped for different brand microwave.  looks good was ok whilst working, found cooking guide chart inside door too small.  had doubts about LG when purchased, but thought after reviews here were ok, so thought to myself give it a go......I did for two weeks"
73,The Good:- Heats items quick- Heats evenly- Easy and intuitive to use- Multiple heating/cooking/defrosting settings with handy key inside door- Touch functions responsive- Large rotating dish plate
74,The Bad:- Nothing!
75,The Lowdown:This microwave is excellent and to date has heated everything evenly and quickly. The inside is large and can hold our largest dish was ease. The touch controls are all easy to use and the addition of the external quick touch is convenient. Cannot fault this microwave and highly recommend.
76,Sparks coming from oven when cooking purchased in Nov 17 its only 7 months old could of caused a fire very disappointed looks beautiful but its not a very safe oven. Will be returning to store for full refund. I had a whirlpool before which i had for 12 years may be i should of stuck to the same brand.
77,This Microwave has 3 Standout Features.
78,You can Quick Start 30 seconds and then slide up and down in 10 second increments. These Quick Start settings are separated from all the other stuff which is shown only when you open the door. This saves me about 30 seconds worth of cooking time as I'm not fiddling with power levels and entering in times.
79,The warranty is above normal. 2 Years Parts and Labour + 8 Years on Magnetron (Parts Only). My Panasonic Microwave died at under 2 years and it was out of warranty period. 10 years on the Magnetron shows you how well they back this product.
80,The Microwave has a really large internal size but minimal outside size. It fits in a space that I wasn't able to before with my old Panasonic Microwave.
81,So far I don't have anything negative to say about this Microwave. If it does die or perform worse I will update this review.
82,"Bought this last July, while broken after 10 months. It makes quite a bit noise when turning on, which is very scary. The service is not too bad, sending back for repair and it takes two weeks. Fancy look, while I really like the design. And quiet while working, but the quality is bit disappointing."
83,"After the last microwave, I was starting to despair that I could not find one that was trouble free, well this is the one.Have had it for about a year and it has been trouble free.I love the time slider for setting cooking times by running your finger to the right to advance or to the left to malfunction cooking times, it is a truly unique feature.The soften feature is great for softening hard butter without reducing it to a molten pulp, like some others.It has an accurate defrost by weight feature, that defosts without partially cooking meat and works well to defrost steak for example.I do notice that it does seem to be a bit slower to heat some things, but at least it heats them evenly.There is one feature that I do find annoying and that is the jingle it plays when finished cooking, if the door is not opened within 30 seconds, it just keeps playing, over and over.I am happy to reccomend this microwave to anybody, I truly believe it is the best available."
84,I was very happy with my purchase and found it very easy to use without looking up or checking out the info guide that u get when u purchase it..it warms up the food exactly to the temperature that u put in and I have also looked up some recipes online and also cooked on it and found the defrosting at good temperatures..
85,"This microwave is powerful, much moreso than the Panasonic Inverter that my workplace uses (takes twice as long to heat up). The settings are easy to use, and the buttons are on the inside of the microwave which might not be usual but it helps the microwave to look sleek and we got used to it in no time. There are touchscreen quick-start options on the outside as well. It's pretty quiet and we like the song that it sings when the food is done - it's a happy little tune! It's quite sizeable and you can fit a fair bit inside the microwave, it is an efficient use of space."
86,"I have had this microwave oven for a few months and it is really good.  Cooks well, reheats well and quickly and does everything you would want from a microwave oven.  Very simple and easy to use,  the display is easy to read and everything is easy to wipe clean.  My favourite thing about this microwave is the happy little tune it plays when it's finished the job....always makes me smile for some reason .  I can't think of anything I don't like about the LG,  it's well built, solid, spacious,  doors are good, the lighting perhaps could be better but that is only a minor concern. All in all I would happily recommend this oven... it functions well and it is very good looking, good combination."
87,"We are very pleased with the ease of use and the quality of the food cooked in this microwave. We thought it might be more complicated to use than our previous one which was a Panasonic. However, we have been surprised at how user-friendly it is. This new LG microwave has much larger capacity than the old one too, whilst fitting into the same place. It works so quietly that I forget it is doing a task eg defrosting. Everything about this LG Neochef seems to be very well-built. I am quite happy with the chiming sounds it makes when finished as it reminds me to take the food out of this almost silent microwave!"
88,Satisfied and it’s loud it is well built and works really good it’s the best microwave I have ever purchased and I wouldn’t want any other one this one is perfect for my house hold and family to use and is cheap and is just real good quality .i love it
89,Not very much wattage takes a while to heat up my food it is a very nice looking microwave tho and fit in very nicely with my kitchen set up I would buy this product again in the near future it just wouldn’t be my first pick it is a very good microwave just needs a few touch ups
90,This microwave leaves many others behind when it comes to innovation and design. Easy to use and is quieter than the Panasonic Inverter. Much more energy efficient on standby mode than the Sharp. Uses LED lighting which is bright and energy efficient. Does not have an annoying fan to cool down the inverter after cooking like the Panasonic microwaves. Cooks evenly and quickly (much better than the flatbed panasonic inverter). Easy to clean. Efficient use of space - it is a 42L microwave but is about the same size as my previous 32L Panasonic on the outside. My only gripe is that sometimes the internal walls clog up with moisture so it needs a rub down every now and then.
91,"The microwave seems sturdy and well-built. It heats up well the food in less the time compared to our last LG microwave oven as this one is higher power. Most of the selection buttons are inside so you need to open the door to select your different method of reheat,defrost,cook etc. then close the door to start.On the front door, you got the Stop and Start and a timer selection by sliding your finger along the -IIIIIIIIIIIIII+ to set your cooking time. Took us some tries to get used to.Two cons:1. When you chose a different power other than 100% it did not show on the display while cooking.2. To change the time on the clock you need to power down the microwave then power up to set the time. Very inconvenient if the microwave is in a cavity and it is heavy."
92,"Does the job but I am somewhat annoyed with the this LG because it doesn't have a timer.  We use the timer all the time.  And to change the clock time by pulling the microwave out of the cavity and flick the power point switch :(  LG, what were you thinking??"
93,"Works well. I just use the basic functions such as reheat, heat and defrost. No complaints other than you  can see the fingerprints on glass door but it is easy to clean.  Has a nice melody once cooking has finished.  Bought on special at JB Hi fi with extended warranty."
94,"I am a microwave cook. I used to be a home science teacher . I am satisfied with this LG model, but could not find a convection model that I could fit in the space I had. I miss my convection microwave, but got used to this model easily. I had a problem with the bulb that went, LG replaced it as my microwave has a 2 yr. warranty. Thanks LG!"
95,great looks and features. Reason I gave a 4 star is the annoying tone to remind you that the food/berverage is still in the Microwave either than that I couldn’t find anymore faults. Would recommend this microwave to anyone who is after a modern look in the Kitchen. LG Life Goods.
96,This microwave is a life saver in our household. When it’s time to clean it is so easy and comes up looking brand new! Very easy to move around if you want to wipe the benches. Very reliable and trustworthy and simple pad to access cooking time etc. we use it everyday and it never fails to impress us.
97,"I bought it last year i must say it's  one of most wonderful product  it's make my cooking easy I also make cake and pizza  ,bread pizza at home  my kids always feel happy . happy to buy this  I  suggest to everyone to buy LG product is good I m"
98,Love this microwave both in operation and looks. Easy to clean and fabulous hidden touch control pad.It’s compact but plenty of room inside. I down sized due to bench space and this is smaller outside but not much less room inside.Quiet operation and catchy little alarm to let you know it’s finished.
99,"This Microwave oven from LG is a great looking easy to use, quiet yet powerful unit!My wife reckons it is a very user friendly device with many highly useful functions."
100,As others have noted the tune on completion of cooking is very nice ...compared to the usual bell noise of older models.No complaints so far & hoping we dont need to take advantage of the 2 year standard warranty it comes with. Most other brands only offer 12 month warranties on their microwave ovens!
101,This product has a very nice look. And it's big enough for my family. It's very easy to clean. I like the inverter deforest and sensor cook functions very much as I don't need to worry about how long the timer needs to be setup. They works so well and my food never got overcooked.
102,"I’m very happy with my new microwave so far. Heats and cooks beautifully. I really like the look of the smooth, button free exterior, with most options hidden inside the door. I did have to look up the manual for explanations on how to use the cooking options  but with that little bit of extra knowledge it was then pretty obvious how to work everything. It has a nice bright interior light so that it is easy to see what is cooking inside. I also like the pull open door - the catch on my two year old Samsung failed for no reason - so I’m glad that won’t be an issue with this microwave. I’d happily recommend this to anyone looking for a decent sized, aesthetically pleasing microwave."
103,"This microwave is big and great quality, runs quiety, door closes quietly and the sound alerts are nice and not annoying. looks good in the kitchen  and is great to use. It melts butter well, has no hotspots and defrosts meat nicely with no browing around the edges so it looks freshIve owned it for over 13 months and cant fault it"
104,"Heats up all my pre cooked meals instantly without any hiccups. Unlike other microwaves the alert for it finishing is a nice song rather than the usual loud alarm found on others. Makes the same noise as a usual microwave would make, maybe a tiny bit less. No complaints from me"
105,"This device Looks great, clean and sleek And has been a joy to use. 42 lts is a nice size."
106,Easy to open and close. Feels solid.Setting cook time/modes is fast and easy for me.
107,"Like the Inverter Defrost and Sensor Cook functions, they work so well. Food is never overcooked or ruined.We like the Cute tune when completes.Very easy to use. I use it everyday and it softens the butter and ice creams so welll. I’m really happy with microwave."
108,The black interface makes it look so sleek. It's also super compact and powerful for it size. Its smart technology means that I never have half a meal heated up and the other half left cold. It also place nice soft music to notify you when the food is ready rather that beeping some blaring noise. LOVE IT!
109,"Brought the microwave a week back and it makes a grinding noise for a few seconds before it starts and stops. I called LG care and the operative was extremely rude. When i asked for technician to come have a look at it, he said since i didnt buy a fridge i have to lug this to the service center 40 kms away. He was not sympathetic and he said there was nothing he could do as it was closing time for him. Very disappointed with the Service. Potential buyers please be aware that after sales service will be lacking. This experience has soured my experience of microwave."
110,"Originally thought it was a bit weak. (took too long, and needed a cooldown time)One the main component was changed it worked exceptionally well, and proved to be well worth the extra warranty I took out on it from the original sale. (zero - $ to me)No longer loud, features are easy but you must read the handbook to understand it's use.Seems well biult and easy to keep clean.Recommend taking out extra warranty, just to safeguard you appliance."
111,After reading many reviews on this model i decided to go with this. Very spacious inside and heats food up evenly.
112,Receive great compliments from family and friends on the modern design.
113,Can leave finger print marks due to the glass front. Great control inside the door with plenty of options.
114,"This product is out of this world amazing couldnt ask for anything more perfect heats perfectly, does everything it is meant to do! its easy to work and understand! and its not loud its so quiet and capable!! its got such a nice look to it also very stilish micorwave!!"
115,This device has been a joy to use.
116,LG 42L Smart Inverter Microwave Oven - MS4296OWS  - NeoChefAnother item I purchased after reading many positive reviews here!
117,"Looks great, clean and sleek.Nice size. Good space for food/dishes (not cramped)Easy to open and close, door is responsive. Feels solid.Setting cook time/modes is fast and easy for me."
118,"Like the Inverter Defrost and Sensor Cook functions, they work so well. Food is never overcooked or ruined.Not too loud, never distracts me. Cute tune when completes.Nothing has been confusing, manual is clear."
119,Device is well set out and labelled. An older person I care for had no issues heating up food.
120,"Great microwave. Really quiet and has a nice sound when finished. Looks great on the bench and the door opens really nice, althoiugh you have to be careful sometimes what you put in there will come out hot. i would recommend thus over a cheap microwave, you can really feel the quality"
121,"I never really liked the idea of microwaves. My father always said that you should never trust anything that does something you don't understand. I still believe this. I used to think they were for lazy people with poor morals. However, since purchasing the LG NeoChef, I've used it daily. Even for things that you wouldn't normally microwave. Things like cakes, bread, and icecream. The list goes on."
122,"Buy one, thank me later."
123,"The microwave is excellent. I purchased last year and it's worked like a charm ever since. It heats food just fine, and has easy to understand settings. It can heat foods to a high enough temperature that some microwaves can't, which I've had problems with before. Overall a very solid microwave."
124,"The microwave in our caravan gave up, so this is the replacement, so happy with it. Does a great job, easy to use, so impressed, have lent it to our daughter whilst the caravan isn't in use. Daughter reckons she wants to keep it, she thinks it is great. Very happy with the purchase."
125,"I am quite satisfied with this microwave as it does the job of cooking and reheating well. The operating functions are simple and there's no need to read the instruction manual. With a low noise output, the depth is just right for most of my plates and although I had some spillage, they were really easy to clean."
126,It is a good buy.
127,"Overall, I am satisfied with the cooking results of my microwave. The functions are intuitive and easy to use. There are so many functions(!) - I have this for 4 months now and have not tried every single function yet(!) If you are after a simple microwave - you may wish to go for other brands (there are cheaper options). IF you are after a big, user-friendly and hassle-free microwave, this is the one to go for. I use it mainly to defrost, warm up and sometimes heat up frozen food. The size is good for me to sterilise milk bottles for my baby. The microwave is loud enough to be heard from our bedroom yet not loud enough to wake our sleeping baby in the bedroom. It is certainly sturdy and well-built."
128,"Microbio does what it should do without any  issues. I find it a bit challenging to navigate through the programs.  It should be more easier to use the preprogrammed cooking options. It is very easy to clean and looks good in the kitchen. We recommend this price, when bought diring offer"
129,"I am very satisfied with the product, very quiet and does the job perfectly. Many options to chose from for desired outcome. Beautifully designed. Settings are really easy to use and self explanatory and I have had no issues so far. I would definitely recommend this product for any one who wants to buy it"
130,"i am very satsified with this purchase as it has been working very well, without rroubles and without any hassles. it is power saving and it is also quite easy to use. good product with reasonable prices, i am very happy with this item, look forward to use it more in the future."
131,"Extremely satisfying upgrade to the kitchen. Unlike my previous microwave, I can actually adjust and make reheating food easier and safer. Apart from its awesome array of functionality, I do wish that the black face of the door was not too dark as sometimes I want to watch what is happening inside the machine."
132,I am really satisfied with tis microwave.New microwave technology has not only made reheating food easier and more efficient but also safer and more convenient. LG is a technology giant and has devled into almost all aspects of home electronics.It does what a microweave should do and more such as grilling.
133,Had the LG Neo chef for a year now works great and does everything it's meant to great bit of gear!LG products just last forever and never get any issues!
134,Would recommend this product to any friends or family who are looking for high quality equipment for there kitchen
135,New microwave technology has not only made reheating food easier and more efficient but also safer and more convenient. LG is a technology giant and has devled into almost all aspects of home electronics and this endeavour is definitely not a bad one. Very usable machine and at a good price too.
136,"Bought from Harvey Norman for $160. Not as sleek as stainless steel but good to use.Didn't read the manual, manage to do all the time setting, easy to use.There is even a cooling function after heating up the food.Cheap and reliable.  No problem so far, good buy."
137,"That’s great looking microwave for a modern kitchen. It has a lot of functionality that will suit any chief :)Stunning black glossy finish will makes your kitchen looking great and modern, even when it’s goind to be only one thing at the kitchen.That’s the best microwave you can buy in this price range."
138,After going through multiple microwaves that kept dying on me the LG works very well. I have had the machine for 9 months and no issues. It has a sweet chime instead of the usual beeps which is unoffensive. It's easy to use - I often use the auto 30 second function and never have any issues with food burning.The only downside is the black face of the machine means you cant see inside the microwave which is tricky when you want to check on food whilst the microwave is running. I would still highly recommend this machine though.
139,I have the LG and am quite happy with it. We don't use any of the fancy features though.
140,It only has a very small number of reviews (5) and one of them is good. You would think they have sold a lot more than that and I would like to recommend to anyone.....
141,"This machine is wonderful.very quick to defrozen the poultry and sea food, less noise. My daughter loves to use it and highly recommend to all of you. I feel very happy to bought this microwave. And it is sturdy and well-built. Really good machine for families to buy for cooking."
142,"yes , it's acceptable condition as my expected.yes , it's same as other product, actually i didn't read it, and just start usenormal , it's acceptable noise, but i hope it can be more quietyes , but i hope it can be lighter"
143,This microwave is great. The touch slider to adjust the time is super convenient. The size is also perfect for all my needs and I find that it heats and defrosts food evenly and quickly. The only con is that my girlfriend finds the song it plays when it finishes annoying
144,Physical appearance and loudness is a main factor in buying a microwave for me. This model is aesthetically pleasing and fits well within the theme of my kitchen. It is strong and not too loud. Fairly straight forward setting up the options. Would recommend to those who need a all rounder microwave!
145,"We use the microwave only for re-heating food and it does that well. To be honest, I chose to purchase this microwave over others only because it looked so much better than the other options form other brands in a similar price range and we have got a few compliments from visitors on the looks of it. The microwave is easy to clean both inside and outside and I don't doubt that it will look the same for years to come."
146,"This microwave was perfect fit for the cabinet, Easy to clean the glass panel and like the touchscreen which is responsive and the dial to adjust the time and cooking options. Defrost chicken without cooking it and have even heat dispersion. The beeping sound is okay and a good reminded too."
147,"Wow, I was so impressed with the amount of settings for this model, and it heated my food so quickly and evenly too.  Even frozen food was no match for this nifty microwave. Plus it was also incredibly user friendly and intuitive, I didn't even have to use the manual."
148,very good. After scouting for a good microwave I settled for this beauty.
149,"Very large inside can fit large bowls. Stylish touchscreen controls. Received many good comments from family and friends. This is a great microwave, with touch panel controls. It has a large 42l capacity. It is also an inverter model which means it can control the power level in a more detailed way rather than the basic…"
150,"This is a good microwave. It is easy to control and has a large capacity of 42 Litres. It can easily fit large bowls. It can also be used to defrost frozen food. I am very satisfied with the product, it works great and it is also easy to use."
151,After scouting for a good microwave I settled for this beauty.
152,Very large inside can fit large bowls. Stylish touchscreen controls. Received many good comments from family and friends.
153,The whole screen is glass so very easy to clean. Inside has some great auto cooking options from defrosting to warming.
154,"This is a great microwave, with touch panel controls. It has a large 42l capacity. It is also an inverter model which means it can control the power level in a more detailed way rather than the basic way most microwaves do it.Melting butter and other items works much better on an inverter model. The touch screen has been ok, sometimes requires a few extra touches with wet fingers."
155,I am satisfied wit ht he results of this product. It works great and easy to heat the food. Setting are very easy and easy to understand. It is less sound as compared to others. it looks beautiful sitting inthe kitchen. clear display and one press for 30 secs. super handy product
156,"Very much satisfied with the cooking results of the microwave, heats any content in seconds. Most importantly, it preserves the taste of the contents inside. The settings and features are very easy to understand and follow to anyone , also the user manual which comes along with the microwave has everything detailed for any queries."
157,"Microwave does some sound, but antyhing not out of the ordinary. Seems very well-built and sophisticated."
158,I am very satisfied with the cooking results of the microwave. Foods which I thought would go soggy did not at all. It is also a lot quieter than I thought & does not disturb me much. The microwave also does not disturb my wifi in the house which my previous microwave did.
159,Clear display and bright light inside the microwave. The best part is just one press for 30s reheat. Super handy. Also it dual display that.You.can set up your cooking time while the door opened and some simple set up while the door closed. A great microwave to have. Great investment.
160,i am satisfied this producti think it is well builtwhen i used  first time it is very helpful my lifeif i have chance this product  i will use againbecuse it is good for meall of people will like this product zzthank you giving chance
161,"We bought this microwave as an upgrade from our previous Samsung microwave. It does a fantastic job at reheating food, easy to use and easier to clean. Initially thought the menu at the back would annoy us but it didn't and it looks great and seamless in our kitchen! Would recommend anyone looking for a microwave in the 300 to 400 range."
162,"We’ve been going with a Samsung microwave for a few years, but when it died, we found this LG."
163,"Looks great, even with the white backing. Super early to use. Avoids the 0-9 keypad with just + or - for 30sec and 10sec increments which makes sense. Wouldn’t want to be setting it to run for 20min though.Seems well put togetherLove that the time on the front says off after you cook something which in great in a busy house with distractions - you can easily tell if someone’s left something in there."
164,Guys at JB price matched TGGs sale price which saved me a trip
165,I purchased this appliance not too long and it has been really good. It replaced our old one which didn't heat the food very evenly but this has lots and lots of functions and is very easy to use and does a good job of heating the food very evenly.
166,This sleek model not only looks good but functions really well. The inverter technology really comes to play when defrosting foods. When defrosting chicken in particular the defrosting process is even with minimal instances of over cooking. I love the clean touch display - makes it easier to clean and use.
167,"The microwave has got a sleek looking which is why we bought it at the first place. It has been working fine for a while until one day when I used it to heat up a cup of soup for 10 mins. At about 6 minutes, I saw spark inside and I quickly turned it off. The microwave is still working fine but I won't leave it on for a long time."
168,"Has worked great since we bought this for our new kitchen. Easy to use, great to look at, and can fit very large dishes/containers. Would recommend as a high end microwave for those who do not want a built in. Purchased from the Good Guys EBay at a nice discounted price."
169,"Well built microwave, solid design. But who cares about that, the food is cooked amazingly through. Great spread of heat and good size. You will.not go wrong purchasing and using this microwave."
170,I have owned LG microwaves in the past and their reliability has always been second to none. Don't hesitate with buying this microwave.
171,"I bought this to replace my previous microwave last September and there has been impressive results. The food warms up equally and manages to still keep the freshness and tastes amazing. If you are looking for a big capacity microwave, this is the microwave that you should purchase. I would highly recommend this for anyone."
172,"Having bought this to replace my previous Panasonic micro, this has served since last November with excellent results. Food always cook great, runs crispier, keeps the freshness and tastes good too. Purchase fro Bing Lee with an offer they had and extremely satisfied with the product ever since. Incase if you are looking for a 40L+ bigger capacity tuntable model microwave, I would highly recommend this unit for anyone."
173,We bought a LG Microwave that came with the Promo of two free cinema tickets.
174,Delivery of the tickets took 10 weeks and only after three reminders we received an internet voucher that came with so many conditions that we finally let it pass.
175,What was meant to be a great marketing promotion ended up to be a marketing desaster. LG - never again.
176,"This is the best microwave I have owned it certainly is a big improvement on the old one, technology has certainly come along way in 6 years. Cooks well and easy to use so everyone can use it. It also looks great so it just blends in with the whole kitchen. Good Value."
177,This is a nice microwave. This is a new addition to my family. Using it from last one month and it works really nice. It has different mode to defrost or boil the potato or for fresh veggie or for frozen vegetables. It works amazing. I am glad to gift this to myself
178,"Hefty price for a microwave, tried it on the recommendation of a friend, but definitely worth it."
179,">Looks very stylish with tinted glass, LED lights and sleek design>Performs quite well, food is cooked evenly no matter where in the microwave it is placed>The new inverter technology makes the operation super quiet as opposed to the humming transformer of typical microwaves>Has good cooking functions that actually help. Easy to use and configure"
180,Absolutely worth it
