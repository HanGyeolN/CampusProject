0,"We bought this product for our car to provide maps etc for camping, it is brilliant and does exactly what we need it to do.would purchase another one when required"
1,"Purchase this because it is cheap. The camera was better than expected.At first, the battery can last for 3 days, but now, I have to charge at least once a day. Not sure if there's any difference between local and import quality."
2,"For the first few months this phone amazed me. It was quick, very responsive and lasted all day with heavy use on one single charge. However this was short lived, I had to replaced the battery and it became very slow. My phone also had a small fault when sometime the focus of the back camera would fail to function. You can get a phone if equal quality for much less so simply save that money and look for a cheaper phone with the same specs from a smaller company without the brand name"
3,Camera quality is great during the day and still good at night as long as you know the right settings. very durable and not worry too much when I would occasionally drop it by accident Apps run smoothly and battery lasts a long time.
4,"The last Samsung phone I used was the Note 2 and then I started trying out a bunch of different brands. After many years, I returned back to Samsung and it was one of the best decisions I have made. Over the years, Samsung have continually innovated on their products trying to bring the BEST to their customers."
5,"S8 has a solid camera (front camera is a bit fake though), good size (easy to hold on one hand or have small hands in general), barely any lag, and beautiful to look at."
6,"The downsides would be the battery is not the best. With Note 7 exploding, Samsung around that time was more conservative with their battery decisions. It could have been engineered with a slightly larger battery. It  does last me through the day if I charge during work hours, but it would be nice if it was just a bit better."
7,"The curved edges are beautiful, but it is VERY hard to find a good screen protector. As a result, I haven't used one since my second month. After almost 1 year and a half of use, it does have some fine scratches on the screen which is painful to see, but hard to notice."
8,Curvy screen can be a problem for tempered glass to stick on. Great camera with good autofocus and low image noise in low light condition. Durable built and ergonomic buttons placements.
9,"I used samsung s5,s7, s7 edge but s8 features are really good. Camera is just best even on night.I Bought s8 on last year and so happy with everything. Display and Brightness is good.Yes because of good ram"
10,The camera quality is great and adequate for daily photos. I love the screen without edge and the size of S8 is just big enough for me to hold with one hand. The apps run on android smoothly and I have had no issues with it for last 18 months.
11,"I had s7 edge prior to buying s8 on a contract.  Personally android platform works better than ios for me so that’s the reason I bought my S8.I think the look is pretty nice since it has thinner bezel but nowdays there are lots of new phones with no bezel so I think it’s starting to get look outdated.The camera is acceptable but not great. I find pictures taken by S8 (or any other Samsung phones) are too sharp and has that Samsung colour which I’m not really fond of.However, the phone is still snappy considering it’s nearly 2 years I’ve been using it.I fixed my screen twice and I got charged $220 in 2018 and $250 in 2019 (price raised..) at Samsung store. The good thing is they replace the battery with the screen free of charge. For the second visit, I went to Melbourne Central Samsung store and they fixed it on the same day which was a bonus."
12,"I have the Samsung galaxy S8 plus. This is one of the best phones I have ever owned. The camera is excellent, video recording is just great, has excellent speaker."
13,i love my galaxy phone. perfect camera resolution. nice design and quality. from the moment i have bought this phone i enjoyed working with it. its size is perfect for gaming and watching videos.
14,"Despite the fact this is no longer the latest offering it has great features, up to date software updates, a great camera and is a phone I would highly recommend to anyone reading this!!"
15,Very durable phone! Camera compares with any top of the range phones!! Good selfie camera snd love the slow mo option! Great storage space! Easy to use and a great variety  of apps that you can download!
16,Low radiation. Quick Charging. User friendly. No issues since 15 months.Good resolution & decent storage capacity. Good camera. Good size & easy to handle and carry.Better than I phone 8. Thank you Samsung!!!
17,Its a great phone.I have using it for past 2 years and I shattered my phone back glass. despite of the I would recommend this phone everyone.Just got it for my father and he loved it too.
18,I have had this phone for over a year now and i am generally happy with it. I love the quality of the pictures and videos. They seem to be better than my wife's iphone x. I also like that it can fit comfortably in my pocket and i can use it with one hand. I also like using the heart rate monitor
19,What i dont like about it is that i seemed to have slowed down a tiny bit after updating the firmware. I will never update firmware again. I also dont like how the facial recognition does not work as well as the iphone x. I also hate the bixby botton. I dont use it and i always accidentally press it. It is very annoying. What i hate the most is the cost of replacing the cracked screen. The cost is practically the same as getting another phone.
20,"Dropped from a coushined seat onto a plastic surface. Cracked phone already. They say that the phones ""gorilla glass 5""  wouldn't crack from 160cm yet it cracks from 40cm. The phone itself works fine."
21,Screen is nice and big and the colours are great. I like the camera and the photo quality is good. Things run well on my phone but since the upgrades in April 2019 it's a bit glitchy with my apps
22,"Having gone from a note 4, this was a big change! Do miss having the stylus but is so much better in many other ways.  Love the camera quality and little features that I didn't have before."
23,Have this phone for a year now and it is amazing.. 64 GB is more than enough space.highly recommended. will not regret. If you can switch from iphone this is the best option for android user.
24,"Me and my son are very happy with our Samsung Galaxy S8.It has a very good camera. Also Apps run very smoothly. I use my mobile phone messaging , calling texting. I use my phone as a camera too."
25,"Over time my mobile was all broken. Front and back. I thought about updating but my phone is still fast. Has a very good camera and is a good size for the hand. Samsung repaired my front screen, LCD panel. Back glass. All the aluminum body and sim card holder.for $340. It took 2 days. AMAZING. I have a new phone again. And saved my self lots of money."
26,"Wife and I are very happy with our Samsung Galaxy phone journey, starting with S4, S6 and now S8.. May I talk about 1 incident that has left us completely amazed.. 2 weeks ago I dropped my car headon into a roadside ditch that happened to be full of muddy water.. My S8 phone landed in the passenger footwell and ended up under 70+cm of muddy water.. The water flooded to above the dashboard.. due to heavy rain we were unable to retrieve the car until next day, resulting in my S8 being  under muddy water for some 14.5 hoursMy wife wiped the phone clean and put it down and we talked about getting another S8 or maybe the S10 under a new phone plan...THEN my phone rang and I have used it every day since...I am completely amazed, stunned, grateful that I didn't lose all my info, contacts etc AND I still have my beautiful phone !!!! Gotta buy a new cover tho..Sadly my S6 drowned in the same accident..My Wife's S8 also took a lot of rainfall and still works great.."
27,NO WAY will we be swapping from Samsung Phones...
28,"Cheers,Vince"
29,"Love the phone (bought Jan 2018).Have had no problems until the March 2019 update.Now apps arent working, and interface doesn't  seem user friendly any more.(Hubby having the same issues with e.g banking, netflix apps).Its a real shame: if the update issues aren't fixed soon, we will have to go for another product that gives less headaches."
30,"I have owned this phone for approximately 1 year and couldn't be happier. The camera takes really clear photos, the battery life is great and it charges really quickly. The screen/display is bright and clear. I use it for emails, banking, online shopping and social media - no issues at all. Very happy."
31,"I chose the Samsung Galaxy 8 because they have a history of being great phones, have the Telstra Blue Tick for phone range, and have a shuffle function in the music player. And in the basics, it does all that. I'm having issue with the cosmetic parts.The curved screen hurts my eyes. I find that I cannot read off the curved screen for more than 10 minutes at a time. I've never had this issue with a flat screen.It keeps asking me to log into a Samsung account and other pre-installed apps - which I have no intention of doing.The phone also keeps complaining that there is no internet connection. It is up to me when I turn on my internet connection. Especially when I don't have a large allowance, I don't want to waste it on advertising while playing Solitare, or having GPS tracking locate me 24/7.With the new update, they chose to change the program icons. Ok they're pretty, somewhat functional. But the icon for Gallery is now similar enough to the Settings icon that my husband with glasses is having to double check every single time.Another irritation happens every single time I open Contacts or Messages. There is a big empty space that takes up more than half of the page, before the messages or contacts start. True, it disappears when you scroll upwards. But why is it even there in the first place?"
32,I don't care about fancy squiggles and curves. I want the functionality and range of the Galaxy S1 back.
33,"The samsung galaxy s8 was my phone for a long time, there are many great things about it including the speed, the camera and the bezels. The UI is wacky and bixby is horrible the support from samsung is very little aswell."
34,"Galaxy is by far the most annoying phone to connect to ANY computer, be it Mac or Microsoft, to download pictures. Forced to use SideSync, a constantly crashing software or third party software to even try. UI for SideSync is bad when is not losing connection. Media Transfer Protocol is never recognizable by computers and you must navegate through heaps of options to even try. What a solid hassle. Good phone, don't get it if you plan to download stuff constantly to your computer."
35,"This latest update March 2019 has been very annoying. I lost Bixby and had to re set him, lots of features simply moved to a different place on the screen eg the types of clocks, which I found annoying. Some  icons changed shape and colour which is just a change not necessarily better."
36,"This phone is easy to set up, easy to use and easy to customise. There are plenty of accessories to choose from so you can personalise your device. The camera is fantastic and it charges so quickly."
37,"Less than 2 years old and the damn thing won't charge because it keeps telling me there is moisture in the charging port.There isn't, nor has there ever been!!!Apparently it is a common problem and users all around the world are getting this   fault on Samsung S8 phones that have never been near water or any type of moisture whatsoever.So once a loyal Samsung user will be purchasing something else from now on and not taking the chance on another dodgy Samsung."
38,I have had the s8 for about 6months+ I have not been able to merge calls. Ive been through the settings and still can't find anything to fix the problem. Is there a solution to this problem??
39,"My S8 was updated a few days ago.  I did absolutely love this phone, the best I've ever had but since the upgrade it does not work properly and even though the settings are right, it does not behave the way the settings reflect.  Very disappointed."
40,"We’ve bought a bit late, but very happy with purchase. Camera much better, bigger size is great. A LOT more menus to work through to set up personal preferences. Love the Edge bar, love the colour choices."
41,"I really like this smartphone, I like the features,  I really like the feel of it in my hands, it has a very good size, the screen however is very easy to damage."
42,Camera quality is awesome thought haven’t used it at night yet. Display is also great. I use my mobile for social media and phoning my family. I transferred all the apps from my old phone to the new S8 and they all are running smoothly.
43,"I love this phone. It goes everywhere with me and it does so many things. The camera is great, video quality is pretty good too. I do recommend a silicone cover for it as it is brittle when dropped. It allows me to do time-lapse content. Battery is reasonable, I use it alot everyday and need to charge it everyday. The only thing against it, is I can't add any extra memory to it."
44,Samsung's S8 is the most un-user friendly phone out of all the Galaxy line. Navigating the settings is no longer simple as previous models. Trying to change downloading software is a nightmare. The back button is absolutely useless and the side touch screen is great for liking peoples posts on facebook I dont like and video calling friends at inappropriate times while in my pocket. Lets not even start on the Bixby button.... I love android but wont be getting anymore Samsung's that remotely resemble this phone... a total waste of money
45,"I've had a Samsung s8 for approximately 18 months. I started having charging issues around 6 months in, with the phone reporting it was not charging due to the presence of water (despite not having been anywhere where it could possibly have gotten wet). This problem eventually resolved itself, although the phone frequently has issues with not fast charging. Programs also crash more frequently that I would expect from other reviews"
46,"I've had a Samsung s8 for approximately 18 months. I started having charging issues around 6 months in, with the phone reporting it was not charging due to the presence of water (despite not having been anywhere where it could possibly have gotten wet). This problem eventually resolved itself, although the phone frequently has issues with not fast charging. Programs also crash more frequently that I would expect from other reviews."
47,"Now the phone has stopped charging at all with Samsung chargers. It only charges using my housemate's Pixel charger. I brought the phone to Samsung and they said the charging port was deficient. However, they stated that they were unable to repair the phone without replacing the entire front and back screen (which had minor cracking, and which I was not looking at getting repaired) to ""warranty condition"", despite no suggestion that this was related to the issue."
48,"I honestly would not recommend this phone to anybody, and personally will not be purchasing a Samsung product again."
49,I purchased a new S8 active and less than one year later the screen got a red tint. Apparently the cause is turning up the screen for too long. The display appears to go bad if you use it as designed. Recommend not to buy it.
50,"Samsung S8 SM-G950F, 64GB purchased 26/04/2017.Screen became burnt in with a permanent image of google maps, tried whatever I could to fix without success and finally sent in under warranty.  Reported 08/02/2018, sent unit in post on 12/02/2018, received fixed unit back 22/02/2018.  Burnt in image had gone."
51,Very frustrated because there was now some tiny particles inside the camera lense which I believe affect the quality of my photos.
52,20/01/2019 I notice I have screen burn in happening AGAIN!  I did not want to go through the pain of factory resetting and sending my phone off in the post again (assuming its still covered under manufacturers fault) and be without it for a couple of weeks.
53,"I asked at my local mobile phone repair shop how much it would be to replace the burnt in screen, it would be $540.  It would also cost $80 to remove the particles from my camera lense.  the phone repair man pulled out his S8+ and showed me that he also has the same screen burn in problem and that is his second screen after sending it in to Samsung to be fixed."
54,So that's the state of play.  Samsung Galaxy S8 models (at least) have screen burn in issues.  This is a manufacturers fault.  The replacement screens also have the manufacturers fault.
55,"I paid $1,200 for this phone and I feel that Samsung should have someone deliver a new phone and take the old phone and then process the warranty fix. This would be the fair thing to do.  The other proper solution would be to recall that phone model and fully refund every customer."
56,"In fairness, it's quite a good phone (so it should be for the price), its just these issues with the screen and camera which to me, is practically the whole physical phone."
57,"After writing this review, in good faith I gave Samsung 7 days to respond to the draft before publishing.  I didn't hear from them."
58,"I have been an avid Samsung/Android user for 4+ years and previously owned the Samsung Galaxy S7.- CAMERA QUALITY: The camera quality is AH-MA-ZING! There are also plenty of adjustable settings to suit your needs whether it's portrait, night-mode or outdoors. This phone allows you to select the right setting for you.- LAYOUT/DESIGN: One thing that swayed me to switch from iPhone to Samsung is the flexibility in designing which colour/theme you would like for your phone. Samsung allows you to customise your phone layout with different colours and icons.- FUNCTIONALITY: With good care, this phone runs smoothly and there is even a section for 'Device Maintenance' where your phone automatically cleans up any free storage, and also shuts down apps for better Battery Life.- EXTERIOR DESIGN: This phone is a good size, however, I have small hands and find it hard to have a good grip when using my phone - but not a major problem. A good solution would be to buy a Pop-Socket or Phone-Ring to solve this problem."
59,ONE WISH:The cable/charger that came with my Samsung S8 did not provide a 'Fast Charging' option for my phone. I have recently bought a cable from Kmart for $8 which provides me with this option.
60,"I switched to Samsung after endless Bluetooth issues with a new iPhone, and this is my first Android phone. I found switching over and transferring my data pretty easy with the Smart Switch option but adapting to a totally different operating system that so much more customisable and less seamless that the Apple system took a while. It was worth the effort though and I intend to stick with Samsung phones from here on out."
61,"The display and picture quality on the S8 is fantastic and I love the full screen design. The sound quality is great for a mono speaker but I'd love for it to have been stereo sound. The camera quality is a lot better than the iPhone 8 that I had although the native setting for the picture display is extremely saturated and unnatural, so I had to adjust it to the sRGB display option to get a look that matched what I saw on other devices."
62,"I'm a pretty heavy user of the internet and social media and for the most part the phone works well in this area. There are times when the Facebook app is glitchy, although I suspect this has more to do with the app itself rather than the phone. Every now and then the Chrome app will freeze up and I'll have to close all apps and the reopen them but I also had to restart my iPhone every now and then for similar issues, so I imagine all phones experience this to some degree."
63,"I've dropped the phone a few times and it hasn't been damaged, although I do have a drop proof case and a good quality screen protector on it. The screen protector cracked slightly during one of the drops but the phone screen seems completely intact underneath. I wouldn't be game to use this phone without protective covers on it as it does seem quite easily breakable, as are most phones these days."
64,I had to sent back my Mobile Phone Samsung S8 to Samsung Repair the 4th time due a terrible Screen Burn (also called Ghosting). I just been told that I can get it repaired AGAIN or they will send it back unrepaired. I just filled out a form to the ACCC (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission) including Repair Invoice attachment and reported them as they probably have not red the laws regarding replacements or reimbursement when there is a problem which can't be repaired or fixed.
65,"I like my galaxy S8, I bought this on a plan with Optus. The camera quality is very good, as it is clear. I don't have any issues with its software and apps. It is easy to use and the size is right for my hand and my pocket. But for the waterproof thing, my little boy dropped this phone in the sink full of water for 5-10 seconds and there was a line in the phone, which was quiet annoying, that is why I gave 4 stars. Fortunately warranty covered all the repairs and my phone was repaired very quickly, so I am very happy with their customer service."
66,"Similar battery issues as previous reviews. Stopped fast charging within 6 months, now takes over night for full charge. Very expensive to repair damaged screen- so much so it’s slmost the same price to start over.  Camera not fantastic quality, poor portraits. Sensors, particularly the year not reliable at all times."
67,"Great user friendly phone with awesome battery power. I was considering upgrading to the new Samsung s10 but... NA, going to keep this model. I use to be a Iphone user but felt limited, I mean each time you need more memory you have to buy the next model Iphone.  Most Samsung phones come with standard 32 memory.  If you want more simply add the memory card. Samsung you make great phones."
68,Brought the phone on virgin mobile plan and had it for over a year now. Generally good. Pictures are perfect but very delicate when dropped on floor even with the cover on. Had some GPS issues got it fixed under warranty. Updates are very bad for the phone i think....now my rear camera doesnt focus properly now and then...over all good phone but be very careful with it
69,I am so disappointed with Samsung. My phone is never been near water. however it does not charge because of the system says the moisture has been detected.Also it has a useless Bixby button that interfere your every action. Also the Samsung service said it might not be under waranty.
70,I love the camera and the photos are clear and crisp. Everything runs nicely on the phone and has lots of storage. its quick and responsive. Besides calling and messaging I am always using it for navigation.   I liked the phone so much I encouraged my daughter to get one also.
71,"Have had my samsung galaxy for over a year and its never skipped a beat.Great camera, not 100% at night but it still works. Apps all run great on it!I do definitely recommend getting a phone cover for it though as if you drop it it can be quite fragile!"
72,"The picture quality is excellent. People have often asked if photos were taken on a serious camera rather than a phone. The screen looks good and the form factor of the phone is good too - nice and big but not too large to hold. The slo-mo function of the camera is also amazing, and is great for taking photos of the kids doing things like jumping into the swimming pool."
73,"Samsung galaxy s8 had excellent design. The user interface is easy to use and highly customizable, the screen is amazing, it comes with 64 gigs of storage and the battery life is incredible! I've tried it on the two main battery settings, high and mid, and both lasted me at least a full day."
74,"Cameras are good with sharp selfie cam and imiproved rear shooter. Display nice and bright. Use it for messaging, calling and videos. Apps run smooth - category leading performance. This is the sleekest phone design yet. Excellent battery life can last for hours provided you have the battery optimization setting on."
75,"Samsung, you did an amazing job with your Galaxy S8.I am very impressed by its features, performance, speed, battery life.I have bought a wallet for it as i like the added protection for my phone, not fond of hearing people dropping their phone and replacing the screen which costs them a small fortune.Just like to say thank you.I am very satisfied with the camera quality and the Mpixels.The durability is only the amount of protection you have on the outer casing.The brightness is great, very optional for personal settings.I use my mobile for various means, calls, txting, internet, gaming while travelling on public transport.The apps run very smoothly,I am so very impressed with this."
76,I love my s8 but do wish it had an iPhone camera! it's got a tougher screen than the galaxy phones I have owned previously and is the 1st to survive a year with no cracks! Apps run smoothly and the phone holds charge for the whole day. I love it
77,"After approaching Samsung Australia for a warranty repair on my 600.00 phone, the SD and SIM holder snapped first time used.. I sticky tapped it together so I could take it overseas.Samsung informed me toBackup phone so that I dont lose any data (again the holder was broken, nothing to do with apps)Send the phone to Sydney for a repairer to see if I broke the phone, then no liability on their partI had to prove it was purchased in Australia, which I canThey would take 10 working days to assess, or I could drive for 3 hours and drop it offWould not provide transcript of phone conversation in case I did take them to courtIt is a 6.00 part, I purchased off ebay as it was less stressful then trying to get warrantyThis phone works well, but if you do buy one be mindful, they used very cheap plastic to hold your sim and sd card, this snaps very very easily.Samsung have lost a long term customer over this."
78,I use for 6 months and it has the hard body when you always falling your phone.but I am not easy for use about screen becue have the edge sometimes my finger touch thatnever warming and never crashing for using a 3d gamecamera is perfect for the family taking a photo
79,"I am beyond frustrated with this phone. Most web pages won't load regardless of whether I'm using WiFi or network provider. When they do open I've had to refresh the page multiple times to do so. I live in Adelaide so it's not like I'm in the middle of the dessert.I've just taken photos and can't change the file size without emailing to myself then downloading and saving back to the phone. This is ridiculous. I have an iPhone for work and don't have to jump through hoops to carry out what should be a simple function.Also, the lowest ringtone you can select on this phone is still quite loud. I don't want to have my phone on vibrate but it's embarrassing when my phone rings so loudly when I'm at work on the quietest setting I can choose.I feel like throwing this phone in the garbage it's so bad. Which is saying something as I've always been a Samsung advocate."
80,"I have had this handset for almost a year now, prior to that another Samsung galaxy (s5) and I believe Samsung phones are user friendly and less complicated than iPhones with better specs as well. The camera has some great features, producing high-quality pictures and videos, the phone also has some features that I'm still discovering like a video display as the home page. The widgets are convenient and the side bar makes it easier to take a screenshot and share things easily."
81,VOC = Voice of the customer
82,"Ok, so whilst I love this phone and all its many features, there are also numerous highly disruptive and defective faults that my particular unit has which has been an absolute bloodbath trying to get a satisfactory repair from the Samsung Repair centre and also Samsung Sydney Head Office.  My problems began middle to late 2017, yes almost immediately after the phone was bought.  The primary faults with my unit are …"
83,"1 – Calls dropping out2 – Phone freezing, needing to be reset3 – When 1 sms message comes in, it is shown as 4 messages."
84,"After numerous queries with the Samsung repair centre, the unit was sent away for repair after I stressed I expected all 3 items to no longer be defective.  I had a ‘motherboard’ replaced however I later learnt that this phone has 2 main motherboards and there was not a single improvement with my issues, just a big waste of my time.I’ve just taken my phone in again (31st October 2018) and begged the question, can this phone be fit for purpose with all 3 of these hardware and software faults completely rectified?   My suggestion was if all 3 were not satisfactorily able to be fixed, that a new replacement unit be provided to me.   Samsung repair centre after asking me lots of questions and not able to book me in (I had to come back a few days later) booked me in to have my handset looked at.   I asked, with all these issues, why don’t you simply take my unit and give me a swapover unit?   They told me the device needed to be sent it 3 times before this could happen.   I also asked if I could have a loan phone, of course not, that would be too much to ask!  There is never one on offer, on every single occasion.   I’ve has to go out and buy a temporary phone as God knows how long this may take and how many technicians and ‘Voice of the Customer’ representatives and managers this will have to go through before I actually get a ‘fit for purpose’ by Australian law phone."
85,"I really do not understand how loan phones are never available for anyone, even a $100 phone. Guys, why not give out a flagship phone, it’s the perfect opportunity to do the upsell after someone has gotten used to it for a couple of days.  I’m able to get a complimentary $50,000 car when I have my vehicle serviced, however even the most basic loan phone is never able to be provided to anyone, even a business customer such as myself whom doesn’t have the time to run around.   That’s the other thing, I’m around 40 minutes away from the Samsung Centre at Marion, the repair centre is 10 minutes away at Woodville however they do not ‘deal with customers’ as they put it there.  Also, the phones are couriered back to Marion, if they don’t offer the service to go and pick it up why not have a courier service door to door whereby the phone can be delivered to a home or business the same day as it is repaired?    You can get a book or dvd delivered quicker from Amazon from interstate than a phone which is a few suburbs away."
86,"Lastly, I had a repulsive gentleman I dealt with via the “Samsung Care” centre whom talked over the top of me, told me he cannot help with any of my matters or concerns and then as I raised my voice and told him how useless this whole process is, he told me he will ‘cancel my repair claim’ and have my unrepaired phone sent back to Samsung Marion since I am refusing to have a repair undertaken.   These were not even my words at all, I told him he shouldn’t be in customer service at all the rude way he spoke with people.   So lets see, the phone was dropped into Samsung Repair on Wednesday 31st October, with an expectation of having a resolution within 24 hours as per the website.  No calls at all on Thursday, I’m chasing down via the 1300 number on Friday to no avail.    The repair centre technician was actually very nice, they admitted they didn’t know how to fix all these issues, or why the sms messages were coming up multiple times, 2 sms messages show as 8, 4 show as 16 and so on.   She said she will recommend to head office for a replacement unit to be supplied.   I get a call later that day from Samsung Sydney explaining in great detail how many components they wish to replace and that they hadn’t done it last time like they should have.   I said ‘mate, I’ve been told this phone is beyond repair, the technicians don’t know how to rectify all the hardware and software problems this phone currently has’."
87,"So this is Friday 1st November.    Saturday 2nd I go out of my way to purchase a new phone as I expected a 24 hour solution.   Sunday goes by, Monday goes by, Tuesday goes by.   I have no idea, this is beyond a joke.   Nothing fixed to date.   Just thought I’d let everyone know, don’t expect service if you have issues with your phone or a legal fit for purpose replacement, even if the phone as the technician implied is basically ‘written off’ for parts.   The story is not finished yet."
88,I have never had any trouble with it crashing or freezing. Love how you can drop and drag music photos etc from computer to phone folders and vise versa easily. ITunes is a real pain. Camera is really good for taking photos too. It's the only camera I use now.
89,Best smartphone and great valueCamera is greatInfinity display and oled display is amazingMy favorite smartphone of all time. The new iphone is great phone too but not good value as it is too expensive.
90,I have been using my s8 for almost a year now and still love it.
91,"The camera quality was absolutely amazing, so clear an captures absolutely everything. I use my phone for absolutely everything an so does my 4yr old son. The memory an storage on the Samsung galaxy s8 is unbelievable, i do not ever have to erase pics or anything.. I habe recently just upgraded to a Samsung galaxy note which I am finding so much better... I AM A SAMSUNG GIRL, I WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER BRAND BUT SAMSUNG..."
92,"Love everything about it. It's quick and it looks good as well. Android runs well on it without any lag. The curved screen looks amazing. Takes great pictures. Not too big and not too small. Fair price for what you. Of course phones can be expensive. But I rather pay this amount for such an amazing phone, than to be frustrated with an interior phone. Or to overpay even more for an iPhone for example which is also inferior imo."
93,"Went from iPhone to this and wish I moved years ago. The phone is so slick and polished to use and the photos it takes are amazing. I’ve dropped it a few times and not a scratch. Only thing I don’t like is the keyboard as the space bar is too small, half the time I hit the . Key instead. Other that that, excellent phone. I must admit the iPhone sounded better when Bluetooth streaming, but still can’t recommend this phone enough"
94,"I dropped my Samsung S8 plus mobile. As a result the front screen cracked, even though I had a case on it. I shopped around to get a quote to get the screen replaced. The quotes ranged from $430 to $450 . Samsung's quote was $450. The replacement cost of the screen is excessive and unreasonable amount to have the screen replaced. This cost is well beyond my budget, and I am sure for many other people.  I am really disappointed. I really liked the phone, but not able to afford the huge repair bill . I did the right thing I thought buying an expensive case to protect the phone and even that didn't help."
95,My phone is too sensitive and does its own thing even with a lock. It also  has useless inbuilt apps like Bixby that l cant get rid of. Its overpriced and fragile. The camera settings are junk and the messanging services keep fighting with each other over who should handle.the SMS service. I wont use Samsung phones again. You get the same thing with a much cheaper phone.
96,"Now, before semi-professional and professional photographers get their knickers in a knot. I do own a DSLR as well as a high end Compact Camera and I know ho good they both are, BUT Samsung Galaxy S8's Photos are more than superb! On a recent European Trip we took 2 cameras incl. the S8. After all when you get to the Eiffel Tower or to watch the Sunset on Santorini and Mykonos, you can't afford to come home with crappy photos. On several occasions, walking around town in the evening and doing snapshots, the best photos (even when watched on a large UHD TV) were on...you guessed it....the S8! Probably because of the 1.7 Lens. OMG, some of the quick snapshots AND 4K Video were just amazing! I have always felt, although iPhones (I used to own several over the years) have a much easier and faster operations system, that Samsung just have better cameras in their phones and Apple keeps trying to catch up. My friend in Germany has the Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the photos from his recent Denmark trip were unbelievably good also, especially on the overcast days. The workmanship of the phone, the feel, the glass, the weight....it's just a beautiful piece of technology. 'Hey Google' works much better than SIRI (no offence but SIRI often thinks I am in the U.S. when it comes to Directions) and the charge lasts more than a day and I am on the phone lots as well as using data to send photos etc. S8 or S9 , you can't go wrong. Go on, just get one. lol"
97,"Fantastic phone (phablet). Awesome camera. Stores everything I need and I love the SNote and Screenwrite capabilities. Very few bugs and they're updated quickly. All apps run smoothly and the size, weight and display are perfect for watching anything. I use it to travel blog making and editing clips and pics wherever I go."
98,Great phone with faster processing and great photo taking capability.The biggest flaw from my perspective is the loss of the soft buttons in order to gain more screen space.Sometimes a pain to get the popup home / options buttons to appear to make navigating apps. The only negative found on a great phone. Battery lasts easily for a whole day despite lots of use.Feels great in the hand and good size for one hand hold / use.
99,"This is an excellent phone. All options available. It takes great pictures even at night.even better than an iphone. Has fingerprint, face recognition etc. Most apps available on google play. It even records mini videos before u actually take a picture. Will buy samsung again if i have to change phone."
100,"I have had the galaxy S8 for almost a year. Have been very happy with it as a phone, does everything I need and more. Way better than an apple, who really have been left behind by android and samsung. I like the waterproof feature and biometrics more than I thought. The rounded screen edges are a little more annoying than I would have thought. Accidental touches are a problem"
101,"Numerous times browsing YouTube, my internet browser or browsing my Samsung S8, it just exits out of my windows with gestures I never intended. This shouldn't be happening especially when I have important documents opened or important Windows opened. It's more a nuisance that gestures cannot be disabled. Fix it Samsung or Rambo will find you!"
102,"Awesome phone, apps runs smooth and fast. So much personalization available, text size, display, colour etc. Dropped my phone in the ocean for an hour and picked it out still working fine. Love this phone. Great camera, both front and back and extensive selection of ring tones. Highly recommend this phone. Worth the money i paid."
103,"It might be me being old fashioned, but I thought the purpose of a phone was to make calls and for that this is no better than the Nokia I had 20 years ago, I like the alarm clock function but that's about all. If only I could delete some of the 'features' I don't have any use for, but some genius at Samsung thinks he knows more about what I want than I do. This is the last time I let my wife do my shopping for me."
104,"I have tried numerous mobile phone brands but always come back to the Samsung. I personally find the menus and features easy to use with everything I need.  The camera is probably the main reason for deciding on this phone, given that it was one of the best available in a mobile phone at the time of purchase.  The photographs it takes are excellent and the photo editor is also good.  This phone does not get hot, as did a previous Samsung model, so this is a good thing. The phone is reasonably heavy, but flat enough that I can fit it in my purse.  I have noticed that the glass does not tend to scratch as easily as other phones, another plus.  I have never had any performance issues and the phone is very reliable. It charges at a super fast speed but does not charge on a pad as fast as with a plug in cord.  The screen resolution and colours are excellent."
105,"Upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S5. It's definitely a great step forward. I chose this phone on value and features. As the S9 is out now it makes the S8 great value. Screan is beautiful and crisp. Cordless charging awesome. Operating speed is spot on for my type of use and storage is fine, as that was a problem on the old phone. Photos are better than the old 5. Love it."
106,Samsung S8 excellent phone runs really smooth besides battery dying in a day it's really fast good camera good pics excellent watching videos on it and going on the Internet fast very smooth very lightweight slim of design very very very good sound through it easy to operate never had a drama very good apps from Samsung
107,"I love Samsung don't get me wrong, but apart from the missing button on the screen there's really not much difference between my S7 and S8.... excpect the look... I mean it's samsung so of course it's awesome but I don't know I was hoping for a budget toothbrushing arm or something more the my s7...."
108,"Easy to use. Volume is great , Picture quality is excellent. My OCD always kicks in when using a phone and this is absolutely perfect for when organising . Different apps are bound to take forever to load but only because it was an iPhone based game, and social media sites, eg snapchat have different fonts but other than that would chose Galaxy s8 over iPhones - first Samsung bought and glad I made the trade from iPhone"
109,always purchase Samsung because I have been so happy with them. the quality of the camera is fantastic - didn't bother taking a camera on holidays because the phone was more than enough. my only problem appears to be that the phone keeps turning itself off all the time which is apparently a software issue that updates have hopefully resolved.
110,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great phone. The camera and screen quality are fantastic. Having converted to Samsung from Apple, I have been very pleased with all that can be done on the phone as a whole. The only downside I have in relation to this phone, is the slight curve to the sides of the screen. This is not the edge model and yet I have found it so hard to find a screen protector that covers the entire screen and doesn't interfere with the swipe functions available."
111,"1. I have a high degree of satisfaction with the camera under the different conditions of the phone, especially the photos taken at night are very good.2. The display of this phone has a good durability, no abnormal situation, brightness is also very good, night brightness slightly brighter.3. In addition to text messages and phone calls, I also use it to shop online, make friends, entertain with friends and watch movies.4. All the applications I use on this phone are very smooth, no abnormal problems, this phone is very good for me"
112,"Love this phone! The clarity of the images and screen is great and the apps are fantastic. The only slight negative comment is that the battery doesn't last as long as my previous Samsung phones, even when the brightness low is doesn't seem to make it last that much longer."
113,"I have dropped this phone into a swimming pool and it has come out working fine and it didn't let me charge the phone until the phone charger port was completely dry, moisture detection.I am so glad that I  bought a glass screen protector, because the screen protector broke and I replaced the screen protector and my phone was completely fine.I can virtually run my entire small business off my phone, with the help of a few awesome apps from google playI don't have any issues with my phone crashing, I have to make sure that I don't let the memory get too full and I only charge it for the required time, No longer, and I use a power pack when I am on the go,  to maintain charge my in my phone"
114,"The GALAXY S8 is the best screen in the smartphone I've ever experienced.I want to say that OLED is a better screen.The performance of the battery is very satisfying to me, at least for me it can be recharged from morning to night, which in my opinion is good enough.The basic function of the system is equally good, such as the built-in SMS function and album operation is very handy,I hardly found any lag in the actual use, whether it was switching back and forth between applications, opening apps and sliding browsing, etc."
115,"Bought new, this phone was $1200 outright. It has a fast processor and the edge to edge screen is lovely. Not the best camera on the market but Samsung is the market leader for android phones and the S8 lives up to that overall. Never had a technical problem or any issues updating that you run into with each software release from Apple."
116,I had the S6 which was a much better phone. The curved sides really annoy me and lots of dirt gets in under the cover. The camera is also worse than the S6. However have never had a technical problem with it. Samsung are great phones just wish this one had a better camera.
117,"so much better than the iPhone 8, way faster and way more pretty, it is fast and the iPhone is slow, it has a bigger screen and the iPhone 8 have a smaller screen, it has more ram and a better processor, it is cheap starting at around 800 and the iPhone 8 starts at 1000"
118,"I have had this phone for about 7 months now and it has not slowed down at all. It has a great camera so I hardly ever need to take out my DSLR. The battery lasts a full day with constant usage. I did break the screen, but I can hardly fault the phone for that as it was a hefty knock."
119,"I bought Samsung Galaxy s8 a few months ago. It is a good looking mobile, especially compared to the fruit brand. Although the Android system has been improved a lot, it is still less stable. After 6 months, the system started running really slow. Additionally, USB-c charger is so bad connected and the screen is just weak. I dropped it down from 20cm height, and then the screen is just crashed."
120,"the camera is excellent, i used to have an iphone 6 and comparing the Samsung galaxy s8 , it definitely makes the iphone look really outdated. I LOVE the full screen omitting the home button.It has succeeded my high expectation of what a smart phone is. there was one issue though about smart switch, was very unhappy why it wouldn't sync up. when it got to about  over 90% it disconnected the transfer."
121,This is my 4th Samsung phone. This phone has been terrible. After 2 months the camera stopped focusing. Took it to Samsung and they replaced the camera. One month after that it kept telling me that there is moisture in the charging port.  This phone has never been wet. Samsung replaced the motherboard. The next day same error. Was told by Samsung Joondalup to tell Telstra and ask for a new phone. Telstra did nothing so lived with it. Now seven months after that the phone won't charge if off and the phone speaker packs up. Can only use it in loud speaker. Told today it was dust in the speaker.  This phone is used in an office and is supposed to be dust and waterproof so not exposed to either. Another year of my contact and then can get a new non Samsung phone. Very disappointed as this is the third major failure and they insist on repair.
122,"Been using phone for about 3 weeks.Most frustrating phone I've ever had. No icons to get screen up so have to guess where to press. Alarm snooze reaction is hit and miss -Sometimes it works well, other times I want to hit it with a hammer. Do like the camera but the zoom and light and dark have the same hit and miss response - in fact the whole phone's like this.  Too busy,  too commercial, too gadget, too much time wasted. This is the 3rd Samsung I've had. Will not get another."
123,"I like that you can delete most apps you don't need, or replace them with your preferred app developers app. I don't like the curved screen. It adds nothing to performance or usability except creating an additional exposed surface that can be damaged. It's also a mess around trying to get the sideswipe panel to show and you end up flicking the page or app you're on instead. Another issues was that screen protectors stopped sticking properly after I had it without one for a month, maybe due to micro scratches but now I need to essentially replace a perfectly good screen to put a protector on it again.. This phone sometimes crashes but overall has been more reliable and battery efficient than any iPhone I've ever had."
124,This is a great phone easy to use easy to store easy to charge I love this phone great price easy to clean and get a new battery if needed takes great photos and videos great for anyone I would recommend to anyone wanting to buy this great phone it is really good
125,"Got the phone with Vodafone promo before s9 released. Beautiful design, thats it. Poor battery life, system lag is very obvious, even slower than my older mobile phone which I bought 3 years ago...Although the phone has the best design, i wont buy another galaxy. Unluckily, i still need to use it for another 1.5 yrs to renew my phone..."
126,"Google never works, either does voice text which the accuracy was one of my favorite features. Never available and makes up words not even close to what I'm saying. Regret leaving my iPhone for this device. Always crashes and I have to restart. This was a huge disappointment. Save your money, dont bother"
127,"Ive had my Samsung galaxy from the day was released in Australia,  overall its a great phone easy to use,  very stylish, love the fact itd water proof ive dropped it several times in the bath tub or kids playing around with water around my phone doesnt worry me thats t h e main reason i bought it and the camera quality in good lighting is fantastis the only down fall is some time while in camera mode it gets blury and couldnt figure it out why but after doung some research a year down down the track found out if u shake the phone it goes normal again if only i knew at beginning i wouldnt have missed out on so many precious photos of my newborn"
128,I got my Samsung Galaxy S8 about four months ago. I like the fact that the screen is nearly the whole size of the phone. It is easy to use and the camera quality is so much better than my old Samsung Galaxy S5. I have always had a Samsung and am very happy with mine.
129,"I have had a mobile going back to the bag phone and I believe this is one of the best. It has the capability to run so many different apps. There is something for every one. If you like to take pics and videos, this is right for you. If you're into music, this is also right for you. If you're worried about the cost of a new screen, DON'T DROP YOUR PHONE. I have never broken a screen. If you are one that continually breaks screens, get a good protective case. The phone feels good to hold. It chargers fast, has a minimum of 64 gb storage. I would recommend this phone for all adults."
130,Love the camera compared to previous models of samsung i have used. Sonetimes at night it is a bit grainy but overall love it for my use as im not big on pictures. I like all other features of the phine and its the perfect size for me. I use my phone mainly to listen to music and watch docos or videos etc which. Its so easy to use and store and organise my apps. The pic and sound quality is also eccellent.
131,now this is a brilliant phone if not the best i have ever had i was always a iphone buyer but got such a great deal throgh vodafone to get the samsung s8 and its amazing the camera is magnificent the clarity is perfect runs my apps with no dramas at all i use it for all my computing needs as i dont own a laptop or desk top and its brillant want to own one of the best phones on the market then this is it i wont go back to a iphone after owning this beauty
132,"The screen breaks easily,  and a replacement cost like a new phone.  I only had the phone for two months and now i need to get a new one..Feels like i was getting ripped off. I would expected Samsung to make their phones more efficient with time, but it seems they doing the opposite so we keep buying new phones.  I've been a loyal costumer for years, but i have to switch to a more reliable brand."
133,i love my Samsung s8 so much i cant live without my  phone i need this because im a carer for my mother we need to contact with her when im working.my phone i love its so smooth its fantastic my music is so good i get in the grove
134,"I really enjoy how easy this phone is to use.The picture quality is very impressive for a phone. I don't bother taking a camera on holidays anymore, I just use my phone.The screen is relatively strong, it remains intact even though I have dropped it a few times."
135,"The camera just as perfect as I expected! There are plenty of filters and effects you can enjoy with.  I play game sometimes, but never feel the heat of the battery which I do satisfied about it.  This phone is handy, run smoothly and can be charged quickly to full level."
136,"Switched from apple to Samsung Galaxy and so far very happy with phone and operating system Android. Very user friendly and fast, Camera is fast and best result. Battery is getting super charged and run whole day. So far very happy with the Samsung Galaxy S8. I am enjoying it."
137,"Best Phone I have had yet, great pictures, great functionality, space (memory), and all the bells and whistles, only issue is the battery gets drained very quickly. It looks good and has already installed apps which can be useful, like the health one which has features like step counter, heart rate etc."
138,"I never thought i would change from Iphone to android until i came across the Samsung Galaxy S8. With amazing battery life, crystal clear large display and booming sound I was very impressed. Anything you need from Gaming to Emails to watching Videos the phone has it covered. Very user friendly. Highly Recommend."
139,Pathetic material used
140,"More sensitive screen, very poor"
141,"poor battery timings, always using of screen saver options to have adequate timing"
142,Biometric and optical lock extremely poor does not works well...
143,Not good option as compare to my  Sony and Apple
144,"Bixby is funny...hardly recognize and find something, need lot of customization"
145,"Wifi, data and signal strength average... my last phone was heaps better in reception"
146,I am still quite new to this product however I have been surprisingly impressed. I have never been a Samsung fan but the screen size is fantastic and the camera is so clear. My only negative would be how Samsung have changed the charger plug so it is now not compatible with previous models.
147,"After being an Apple man for last several years I decided it was time to switch to the other side. Worst. Decision. Ever.The galaxy S9's operating software is terrible. Apps often freeze, simple functions just aren't there. You need an app for this and a app for that, nothing just works.While the curved screen looks fantastic, it causes way more anger than the joy it brings. Typing a message continuously includes random screen gestures from the sensitive screen.Bixby is as helpful as an armless tennis player."
148,"The camera, after just a few months, always opens blury and the phone needs to be shaken or whacked to get the image clear.  Samsung have supposedly never heard of of this issue before."
149,Samsung customer service....well there isn't enough space on the net to complain about that.
150,Get an iPhone or anything other than a Samsung
151,"Phone looks great but the back glass broke after less than 2 months when Phone fell from car middle console 1 ft down onto the padded car floor.In one out of 10 phone calls there's a terrible echo for the other person on the line. It usually disappears after 45 seconds but I can't use this phone for my job.Now, 4 months after I bought the phone the back camera has failed, can only take selfies now.The idea of this phone is great but the quality is terrible.Also the user interface is cumbersome.Visually the phone is beautiful, such a shame the durability is so bad.My last two phones lasted 4 years each, this one didn't make it for 3 months.Waste of money, buy a different phone.Purchased from dicksmith.com.au it’s a grey import apparently so Samsung doesn’t honour the warranty in Australia.To get support from Dicksmith, you need to send in the phone which can take 30 days plus transit times. Not happy."
152,"This is an amazing phone with taking still shot photo's, and for space, mapping and lots more. The biggest flaw with this phone is being Brand New no companies stock the tempered glass screen that protects your phone and LCD light. And photos being captured within windy areas become blurred. Otherwise the product is great."
153,"The samsung s 8 does the job of a very good phone. I have owned an iphone before, and i do not think I will go bank to an iphone. the samegsung s 8 itself has what an i phone can deliver, or even more. Love the android on it!"
154,"When I bought this phone I was  very happy with it for a very short while,  I bought this phone about 5 months ago at the most.  About 6 weeks after I bought it  screen burn appeared on the screen and its impossible to get rid of apparently the only way to get rid of it is to have the screen replaced and for what only to have it happen  again,  no  I don't  think so as the phone cost me 740 pounds 5 months ago at the most.  I will not buy any more Samsung mobiles at all because the S9 will be  just as bad as this one and all other phones they have coming out will only get worse.  Now I have to sell this phone to get another one a better one not a Samsung phone."
155,"Intuitive, beautiful, easy to use. Bought this after upgrading from S5 - markedly improved performance with most apps. I mainly used it at work with multi-tasking - including scanning documents, uploading to the cloud based database, and emailing on the go - all worked perfectly without any glitches."
156,"Also the camera is absolutely fantastic - quality is brilliant, and taking pictures of my son is an easy now due to the quick and responsive buttons!"
157,A beautiful technological wonder and a good step up from S5. Kudos to Samsung!
158,I've had this phone for over a year now and it's a great phone. Graphics are excellent as well as battery life where I only charge it once a day. Camera is way better than my old S5 where I had to charge many times a day.
159,The only thing I don't like is how they removed the buttons down the bottom to make more room which can be a pain sometimes.
160,"So powerful and fast, games look incredible, sound quality amazing and the camera takes crisp, clear and beautiful pictures, truly unreal quality. With enough storage to download some of the best app's and games in the market also comes with a great set of earphones and a charger cable that goes in both ways (so easy when trying to plug your phone in the dark)"
161,I have the most up-to-date software as far as I know all legal information and everything else is completely up to date but it doesn't work much faster than my S6 if it all in fact I've had more troubles with the S8 than I ever did the S6. Everything constantly requires updating and it comes out with a USB c so it's not compatible with any of your charges or chords you need to buy adaptors and stare chords as the one that came with my phone someone still on and I was unable to use it which meant I was unable to use my phone this caused me major issues
162,Nothing works on this phone. Camera hangs out. Pdf doesn't open. 3rd party apps don't work. Most importantly adds keep coming from every side. So super cheap. Camera has amazing clarity but not trusted as doesn't always work. You cannot depend on this phone. Samsung might try to do good in the market but will probably another 100 years to go anywhere near Apple.
163,Don't recomend this phone at all for sure.
164,The worst mobile phone I have had & the 3rd Samsung I have had & no corrective support from Telstra or Samsung.It may be a good toy but a rubbish phone.  despite repeated efforts to have my problems addressed neither telstra or samsung will offer any reasonable explanation or solution.The phone constantly terminates an incoming call when the answer button is pushedMy next phone will not be a samsung I can't wait to get rid of this one
165,"I have always been Apple everything but with the battery life not being great, I swapped to Samsung. I wasn't convinced I had done the right thing when I bought the S5, but the S7 and S8 have been amazing! I have an S9+ for work also. The S8 has an amazing camera, its really easy to navigate, so many apps are not Android friendly, I literally cannot fault it. Its nice and light and fits in my purse too."
166,"I have had this phone for just over a year and I love it! It is so handy, the camera works really well and there's just so much to do on it. The music is great and sound is quite loud, the screen is very clear and it's a really sturdy phone."
167,"I have had the samsung 8 for a year now, it takes the best photos and videos, is a great size and has so much in built space. It will be intereating to see how they can possibly upgrade this as it is amazing as is. Would recommend this phone 100%"
168,I bought samsung s8 in september 2017. Yes it was good its camera quality specialy was good. Its scren shape also looks amazing but there is a serious issue with its screen because of edge when ever it falls even from a very low distance it gets broken and after that the broken screen gets bigger and bigger and if falls for second time you have completly lost your cellphone.Though all i can say its a good model but screen is so worst .
169,"After converting from apple, i have not looked back since. Overall it is a good phone. Great fast charging. Only down fall is the screen. There are no real screen protectors to fit this phone due to curved edges. This was confirmed by a Samsung employee. After only having the phone for after a few months i dropped the phone from a very small distance onto carpet. I opened the fully enclosed samsung case it was in and the screen was cracked."
170,"This is a great smart phone, battery lasts for ages and lots of space.  Mine just updated it's firmware to Oreo and now it's even faster.  Lots of case options for these phones.  It's also handy how the apps update themselves when it's back on the home wifi.  And it still comes with a calculator!"
171,"Love the camera, anyone can use it. Seems to be no limit how much you can load on it so life gets easier and easier. Got a free tablet with it which boosts my gigs and a sweet shockproof case which has saved me 6 times. Pretty cheap, upgrading soon."
172,"I thought that going from apple to android would be difficult but the samsung galaxy s8 has made it easy! Such a great phone! Fast and great storage space and has some good case options. I thoroughly enjoy the emojis as they differ from apple devices. Good sized phone, fits perfectly in hand."
173,"great phone takes great photos has a lot of space just a all around great phone incredible camera sleek design , if anyone needs a great phone I would say s8 is the 1. I have a a lot of phone but always go to Samsung are the phone to use"
174,"I was very hesitant about buying this phone as I have never owned a Samsung before, but it is actually the best phone I've purchased as its so easy to use, has a great battery life (usually lasts 1.5 days for me) and a lot of apps utilise the bigger screen."
175,I've tried several different phones. I can be a little fussy. The S8 is the only one i found that has the features and quality i need. So much so that i haven't even utilized all of it's features yet. It's loaded up with apps now and still runs perfectly.
176,"I've had my s8 for less than a year. The technology is incredible. So much storage, incredible camera, sleek design... BUT. It's like it's living in a flimsy plastic bag. The first thing I do when I get a phone is put it in a case and put a tempered glass screen over it. Unfortunately i could not find any combination of the 2 to work simultaneously on the s8. I wasted cash on experimenting but the glass screen would just come off when the case was on and trying different brands didn't help. So, i just kept the case and removed the tempered glass screen. BIG MISTAKE! I dropped my phone from the passenger seat of the car to the carpet floor below the passenger seat of the car and the screen smashed. Ridiculous! What is the point of the fantastic tech if it's kept in a sub par casing? I haven't replaced the screen. Don't even get me started on the cost to repair the screen. No thanks, I'll just hold out till the new iphone comes out."
