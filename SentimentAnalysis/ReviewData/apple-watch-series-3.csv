0,"Perfect watch!Light weight, stylish can't think of any drawbacks.Works well with alarms and after a swimLove the function now I do not have to enter password for my Mac when I'm wearing the Watch as it is automatically unlocking it."
1,I love the watch from the day I bought it. I don’t have the cellular function but this doesn’t bother me as I carry my phone around or it’s always within the distance required to make the call.
2,"It’s a great device for tracking my activities during the day. It keeps track of my steps, walking or any exercise I do. Also it notifies me about my msg, emails or any other notifications important to me so I don’t need to have my phone with me all the time but still keep track of important notifications. I also use it to listen to music without taking my phone out with me. I love this product and recommend it"
3,Worth the price tag considering what some people would pay for a simple analog watch with a brand logo on it. Great for tracking your fitness and easy to look at messages and notifications. The replying does get a bit sluggish at time.
4,"I never realised how much having a smart watch would motivate me. Quite simply, I've exercised almost every day since purchasing the watch whereas before I would be lucky to get out and exercise maybe once a month."
5,He Apple Watch needs to have more accurate fitness tracker. The god tracking is good and the battery life on the Apple Watch is amazing. Buy he Apple Watch if you need to check the notifications when In important meetings
6,"Have been using it nearly every day, mainly for calls and music. Some apps don't update as well such as Facebook messenger, but everything else is very streamline & easy to use."
7,"Absolutely love the Apple Watch. I’d be lost without it now. It gives me the freedom to move around at work, pack boxes and talk on the phone yet have my hands free of the phone while I do things. The quality of the sound during a phone is surprisingly very good. It lets me know that I have text messages or Skype messages with a nice tone and vibration on the wrist without having to constantly pick up the phone to check every time. At work my phone is constantly receiving messages and calls and it is so nice to not have the phone in my hand all day."
8,"This watch is my daily driver and it is amazing. It helps me keep track of which lessons I have and where I have them and gives me notifications at my fingertips where I don't have to pull out my phone, for example in a movie. After about a year of use it does get a bit scratchy tho but other than that it is a perfect compliment to the iphone."
9,"The watch and all its features is great. However, it cannot handle everyday wear and tear and will crack very easily, which Apple can repair for you at a cost just below the price of a new watch.Three months it lasted, not even wearing it during sport."
10,"I purchased this watch 2 years ago, using it everyday day and all I have to say is that it works as the first day I bought it and the rubber and components which it is made off  looks like new. A good watch to buy, and more now that the price has drop a beat."
11,I love this watch. I have an LTE version which means you can use your watch as your phone even though you forgot to take your mobile. Very handy feature. Love the look and build quality. Speaker phone is very clear and easy to listen to. Only downside is the PRICE.
12,"As an Apple user, an absolute beauty to the apple addition.Use it every day; battery life serves me well. Bluetooth compatible with BOSE wireless headphones, making every day tangle free. Records physical activity accurately, even when submerged underneath water.Well done Apple."
13,"I received the iwatch s3 as a gift from my Mum, which probably saved for this for months. I tapped the wall with the watch, the screen smashed. Apple will charge $420 for a new screen which is ALMOST the cost of the new watch. I feel extremely ripped off, I also had received accessories for the watch as a gift from my sister. So everything is just sitting there at home. I used the watch for 2 months at the most. I feel terrible about this and I believe it is completely unfair to the consumer, I would never recommend this watch to anyone. It is definitely not built to last... like a lot of things these days."
14,"Was getting changed when i heard a *bang* looked down and the watch had exploded, the glass screen had come away from the watch.Took it to the apple store, genius went over it with a microscope, found a tiny crack and then told me that it must have been accidental damage so isn't covered.When i questioned this he was rude and asked me to leave.Look through further reviews and most are the same, build quality is awful"
15,"Helps keep me active,can track my steps also can track what ever exercise you do, best watch ever bought, it is worth every cent. It is easy to charge and also very easy to use"
16,"Happy with series 1, 2+yrs, 3mths out of warranty. Face crystal fell off! Took it back to Apple Store: battery had swollen. Apple action? Nothing. Suggested buy a series 4."
17,"Now I’ve broken the watch face on 2 apple watches in a 6-month period. One, I don’t even remember hitting it on anything and now there’s a hairline crack around the entire face. It’s cool because it flips open so you can see all the cheap Chinese garbage inside."
18,I was trying to decide whether to get the latest watch or just go with third gen. So glad I got this one. I mainly use it to track calories out and steps. Love it so much and don’t go a day without wearing it.
19,If you are looking for a watch you can use as a phone the Apple Watch will be  the best purchase for you. But if you are hoping to upgrade your FitBit to some thing you are able to swim in and track all your fitness....stick with your FitBit type watch that’s waterproof.
20,"I love my apple watch so much. I was never a watch wearer until I bought my apple watch. It's incredible!! I use it for practically everything exercise, calling people, apple pay and so many other things. Definitely recommend 10/10."
21,love this one as i can answer my phone even if i am in a pool. so handy and of course the style is as Apple always does perfectly.  I am an Apple user lover and recomender in every way. i dont use it for fitness only the rings
22,Best watch yet! Gets me moving during the day so I get my steps and exercise goals! Also reminds me to breath!!! Best yet I now can’t miss a call! Love it
23,This watch is great it is able to monitor my heart beat and measure my exercise. very useful and also a nice slim design. I wear it every day. Love it
24,"The watch is a nice phone accessory but a terrible fitness tracker. The build quality is poor, it didn’t last a year. It cracks as easily as a caselss iPhone 6 and Apple claims the warranty is voiced offers for a cracked watch. Reporting to office of fair trading. They not have terrible and rude service."
25,The watch itself is very usefulBut it’s not made with the strongest materialHave to always take it off when gardening or even doing the dishes as any small knock a mark/line will appear
26,"I love my Apple Watch, it has some great features. However there is a few small things that I wish where different. Eg. The bulky band, and Siri being too sensitive."
27,My hubbie gave me apple series watch 3 rose gold 38mm.. i chose 38mm as i have small wrist. In terms of fitness it is very useful as it has a lot of features you can use while working out. I also use it twice to find my phone(misplaced most of the time) i tried installing games but screen is too small for playing. Its very easy to pay with apple pay with it. Tried it with siri and it does work fine with it. The downside is that the battery empty fast. Battery didnt last long for a day.
28,"Used watch for a couple of months , had to contact apple a few times to get it re synced which was annoying , got sick of that and recharging too often so stopped using after about 12 weeks , put it back on 8 months after purchase and screen just cracks. Took to Apple and they said they do not offer repair or exchange i must have smashed it , no , just crap quality , i have worn my glass TAG for 15 years day in day out and never had a screen smash. Only thing i was offered was to purchase another watch with $100 off. As if. As a fellow manufacturer it amazes me that they are allowed to get away with selling a defective product , not offering repair , especially under warranty , and only offering a new watch at a slightly discounted price as a replacement ( probably reconditioned as well so would not be a new watch i am sure.) So they get $970 within 1 year for a $550 watch , it's a total scam."
29,"I've had my Rose Gold Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) for over 12 months now, it was very easy to step up and pair to my iPhone X and other apple products.  It has alot of Apps which are on your iPhone so it's a backup, like when you play your music you can skip songs etc.  Love that it is waterproof and I can receive texts and calls on my watch.... I'm sure this will last me for years.... as my Fitbit keeps breaking..."
30,I was a little disappointed with the product. It was great for the first month but soon realised that I spent more time charging the watch then wearing it which was a disappointment. Would I buy another though? Yes!
31,"I don’t use my apple watch everyday, but when I do I find it super useful. Calls, messages, notifications in general. Just a bit easier to do a quick watch glace rather than fighting through the handbag trying to find the phone."
32,"I find the activity / fitness tracker very useful for walking.I am not a watch person, but I do enjoy this product."
33,Recently I have purchased Apple watches for my whole family members as well as friends.All are satisfied with the facilities provided in watch. With attractive models.We have recommended to our friends also for this product . Mostly stylish watch I have ever purchased and look is amazing. Really love to recommend to everyone
34,Connects to phone easily and is very easy to set up. Taking calls on watch is clear and messages are readable. Excellent fitness apps and straps are changeable which is a great feature to have. The actual watch is light weight and it’s battery life lasts for a day depending on use.
35,"Let me preface this with the fact that this is my fourth digital watch. The first being a Fossil which I loved but as is often the case was dead within 18 months. Soon to follow was a Nike watch (by TomTom) after that an actual TomTom Spark and lastly the Apple Watch. Each has lasted about 18 months before the battery life (or lack of) rendered them useless. So as of now, I expect the Apple watch to fail in 6 months. However so far so good and it seems to be still lasting a solid two days per charge, if not overtaxed with navigation etc. I tend to remove it each evening and set it in a charger which is an easy habit to get into. The UI is ok and most apps seem to kind of work. At no point would this be useful without your phone as a powerhouse to do the number crunching. The reason for the three stars is that there are a whole lot of apps and icons you just can't get rid of so it is always cluttered with stuff you may never use. I don't need my watch to track the stock exchange yet there it is, day in and day out, just waiting for me to accidentally press it and generally get in the way.  It also competes with the phone to answer you when you use Siri and does not seem to know what music app you are currently using on your phone so if you try to use your watch it cuts in and stops the current song (even with iTunes / Apple music). If you put your phone on silent you also need to do you watch separately or it will ring independently so going silent means turning off the phone then the watch and the opposite to get it all active again. Love being able to answer calls and this feature is much more valuable than you may think. So 3 out of 5 but that's more than I would give any of the others I have owned."
36,"Bought my wife the series 3 in December, she was just getting the hang of it and enjoying it when she dropped it and the screen just shattered. So ok , its just a bit of bad luck, we will get it fixed, well we couldn't believe it, the screen costs nearly as much as the watch. The certified repairer said to just buy another watch. My wife is stricken with guilt as the watch is only a month old. I think its going to end up in the bin, what a waste of $400.I wish I knew that it was not quality as I would have taken out insurance. No more Apple for this family"
37,I had my watch for a couple of months. The screen cracked and I returned to Apple they said it had a chip in the crack and couldn’t be done under warranty $390 to repair.   I only paid $550.    I am not sure how it broke and  was willing to pay for a repair but that amount is just over the top.  Which is why I won’t pay for this repair as it is likely to happen again    I have been an avid supporter of Apple but no longer.
38,"I was tossing up between getting the series 3 and series 4, and decided that I wouldn’t get enough use out of the extra features to justify the big price difference. This turned out to be a great decision as this watch has been perfectly suited to my needs and looks really good too."
39,"The apple watch series 3 has worked great so far, love the look and the use of it. Found it very useful in terms of calling and texting. As I am the type of person that somehow never picks up phone calls, the phone has helped a lot so I don't miss any important calls. But battery life is a little short, if I use it the whole day it goes to about 20% of battery thus needs to charge every night."
40,So your thinking of buying an Apple Watch ! Try another brand. I had gen 1 what a failure. You’ve probably read my previous post. My gf bought me gen 3 for my birthday she had good intentions within 3 months again similar problem to gen 1 the whole glass face fell out. I did get a little aggressive when I returned to Apple when they said may not be a warranty issue. OMG Seriously this company is making an absolute fortune out of this poorly made Watch it’s design is purposely floored. Any minor impact to the beveled glass edge causes fractures in the glass you may not see it but it is damaged and will surely fail in time to come. Folks this is an expensive junk Watch I’ve bought cheap made in China brands that have outlasted this rotten Apple. All you are paying for is expensive software in a cheaply made Watch case designed to fail.
41,"Bought my Apple Watch series 3,  2 months ago, just love it. It does everything the 4 does and is much cheaper, the only difference I can see is that the screen on the 3 is smaller but I don't find this a problem. It has some awesome apps, my favourite app is OurGroceries, I just touch the icon on my watch if I am cooking and say what I want added to the grocery list. My advice would be, do your research and work out what you want your Apple Watch for. The series 3 is awesome, best thing I have bought since buying my Apple Mac laptop!"
42,Hi I recently purchased an Apple Watch three and when I got there to the Apple Store the sales assistant was very very helpful he explained to me that I wouldn’t need cellular it’s basically a call diversion service I’ve had the watch now three months have never had a problem with it does everything it says it says it does and I could not be happier excellent value for money anyone looking to buy one of these watches are we highly recommend this watch
43,I found that the fitness tracking is amazing once you figure out how to use it (not as user friendly as the fitbit) but the Apple Watch is one above the rest with so many features - especially now since Spotify is compatible with Apple Watch. I find it very useful to reduce my phone use by having notifications on the watch and I love the fitness tracking integration.
44,I bought this watch after the series 4 had been released. I couldn’t justify the amount for the new series so went with the series 3. This watch does everything expected of it and it is a nice looking watch. Has all the Apple features and provides me plenty of options. Great all round watch for both a dress watch and a fitness monitor.
45,"I was so excited to get my Apple Watch. I purchased it from JB Hi Fi.I bought one for a staff member there and then a month later from the same place.I was not offered insurance both times.The face smashed so easily, I now have the glass in my index finger which needs to be surgically removed in 2019.I’ve had many watches over the years and never has a face smashed.I’m so disappointed in the lack of care or concern from Apple and the arrogance when I went in there to tell them.I have all Apple products which makes me feel so dissatisfied with the company as a whole...I’m not on my own with feeling this way.People will eventually get sick of the arrogance Apple.So very disappointing."
46,"i purchased  this as it’s  not always convenient to have my mobile on me. As it’s linked to my phone I can see text messages, answer calls n track my fitness steps even. Fantastic product, would recommend to anyone. Now I can leave my mobile in my bag. Great battery life and the screen all though small is easy to read"
47,"Definitely recommend this product for very active people. I got this product for my birthday and I wear it everyday. So good to track your daily steps and also love the fact that it is waterproof. Also love that you get your notifications on it and can reply to text messages, highly recommend this product!"
48,The watch is beautifully crafted with great technology. I use it for running and it fits perfectly on my wrist. Absolutely love the watch and recommend to those who are unsure of getting one. Worth the money! The wristband is also very nice. I especially like the curved screen and how apple decided to keep the screen small.
49,"Apple Watch great for fitness and heart monitoring, everything is great so far, but that small recharge dongle is miserable, common apple you can do better, this thing keeps flit floppier everywhere, check out Samsung’s one! Maybe you can get a better idea, otherwise 5 stars, enjoying technology these days!"
50,"I received my watch as a gift in Dec last year and love the watch. It helps me organise my day, I know when my next meeting is and can see what messages I’ve received and can even simply respond. Best of all I never miss a call now, the gentle vibration on my wrist alerts me where my phone isn’t always with me."
51,I am experiencing a defect with the watch were it is sometimes not responsive doesn’t respond when I try and close an app. I’ve already gone into a store once and they suggested a software upgrade which I did. The issue seems to be back. The queues in the Highpoint store are ridiculous I just can’t afford to line up for a hour which is very inconvenient. I will however have to go again before the warranty expires
52,"everyone should have one a product is going to last forever. I trust this product for all generations now and in the future, very useful for working people. people they want to lose weight, keep fit in good shape manage their day to day life. I recommend this product for anybody who needs a piece of technology its fresh from the boat"
53,Great features but I prefer my phone so I went back to wearing a watch.
54,It has lots of same features as iphone but I use a samsung so not compatible.
55,"It's ugly - so don't like look of it and its a bit big, I prefer small watches."
56,I'm sure one of my kids could use it - I'm not as tech savvy and I'm sure it has a lot of features but I'm use to my phone.
57,Sitting in a drawer now
58,was initially fascinated for wearable technology.  quality is good as you can expect from apple but i am putting this to sale. as not that using by me. may be those who are too much addicted to technology can feel different. i dont this is a must have. and i personally thing there are lot of situation you can use it without actually going to pick the phone. but still i dont prefer . its a great technological product. look good .
59,"The best watch ever, has such great features. Will never go back to a normal watch again :) love that it’s water proof! The scribble function for messaging is great or talk to text.And I love being able to say... hey Siri .... so helpful for reminders and alarms"
60,"This was one of the greatest purchases I've made.It tracks my exercise for me and keeps me on track in relation to how far I'm walking, it reminds me to stand up every hour and keep active, and tracks my heart rate.It's also good for a calendar when I'm in meetings. I set reminders and it reminds me I have another meeting and need to wrap this one up.Such a great device, I highly recommend buying it!Battery life also lasts 3 days which is amazing!"
61,This is my first Apple Watch product and I am so far pleased with the results. It allows me to sync up my phone via Bluetooth and take calls effortlessly. Price was a little high in my opinion but overall build quality is pretty nice. May upgrade to the next generation watch in the coming few months.
62,"Best product I’ve ever brought from Apple, it does everything. I can read my WhatsApp messages and reply when in meetings it even buzzes on my wrist when I need to take a turning on the sat nav!! Cannot rate this product more highly if I tried! Apple rock as ever"
63,"This watch is pretty good. It has a good battery life (however it seems to start degrading after around half a year). The watchOS is a good software and is easily run. The biggest let down to this device would be its durability, although it can withstand drops fairly well, it scratches very easily."
64,"Bought my Apple Watch series -3,6 months ago. Had been wearing it on wrist every time except when sleeping. While in a waterpark, my wrist suddenly felt very hot. When looked at the watch the display wasn’t showing when I tapped once, so tapped a couple of times gently and the whole glass came off the rim.  Poor quality of watch. A watch that is meant to be worn at all times and track your activities, is so delicate that it can’t withstand even the slightest impacts. I feel it is a total rip off."
65,Ive had this coming up to a year. Its brilliant. Im bit of an apple tech. Apple computers for me so the watch works great with the laptops. Dont even need a password to unlock the laptop. Unlocks with my watch. Great for on the mobe business transactions and great as an all round fitness watch. Will be keeping this watch for a long time. 10 out of 10 from me.
66,"The Apple Watch series 3 is a handy device that helps you track your fitness levels, it is very accurate at recording your steps, and it also has many functions including the ability to monitor heart rates. If you own an apple phone this is the perfect pairing device. I would recommend it over the other similar products such as fitbit as it has a better screen and the ability to install apps from the app store. It also supports apple pay and makes it easier to pay which is especially handy if you have supported products such as an ANZ credit card."
67,"Love it so much it is amazing to use to track your activity and heart rate.My only negative about this watch is the fact that I pay my service provider extra each month for the data on it, yet i cannot make calls or send messages should my phone not be close enough."
68,"To start I was very skeptical about purchasing this watch even though I own and love several Apple products. I wasn't sure if a watch was a necessity. My primary reason for purchasing this watch was for fitness tracking. I figured If I am going to spend the money on a fitness tracker I might as well purchase an Apple Watch because I can use several application versus one like you get with a Fitbit. Very satisfied and impressed with the capability of this watch. Before purchasing just remember the watch is not meant to be used like a phone, its for quick glances. I find myself using my phone less because I do not have to pick up my phone to reply to a text message or even answer a call if I chose. Apple did an excellent job with this product and I have not experienced any issues, including speed problems, after having it for 3 weeks."
69,"I bought this watch for my brother's birthday present, and more than him I am in love with this. I might buy one soon for myself. Great watch for people who love talking while driving so easy to use does not require any attention or touch to the watch can do it all with the voice command."
70,"As the replacement for the Apple Watch 2, this device is the flag-bearer for fitness and longevity, with run and cycle tracking on board and a water-resistant casing for swimming, plus the same heart rate monitor on the underside. In early 2018, we used the watch for a week of intensive exercise"
71,"As a mother, manager and first aid worker this watch offers me flexibility and versatility to keep in contact with my children, managers and emergency contacts.I also love the fitness tracker that helps me to push myself every day towards those 10,000 steps!Even gives me the ability to change music etc in the car without touching my phone, and warns me of upcoming turns through my map directions with pulsation."
72,"As a mum with a little one I needed something I can use when my hands are busy (which is all of the time). I love the ability to get Siri to text someone I’m running late, call someone when I missed their call and set a timer so I don’t leave something in the oven for too long. Also, proving a Mum is run off her feet, I never do under 13,000 steps a day."
73,i just wished some of the apps available would work better. I hardly use anything else because they really haven’t thought about how small the screen is and why someone would need to use something on their watch instead of their phone.
74,"I bought the apple Watch Series 3 people feel very satisfied with the reduced dependence on the phone look good, wearing it is also very comfortable, do not like the place is, the boot time a bit long. Then another point is that the screen is sometimes not too sensitive, it may be too small screen for the sake of overall good, quite like."
75,"Break the traditional specifications, to create a new era of hand, the combination of intelligence and technology, I like this watch, I think in the appearance of the modern aesthetic point of view, intelligent design is also more humane, Apple watch a feature is to set different styles of the dial, with automatic wrist-lift display, Very cool."
76,"it is a great product, highly recommended for business man, it helps with calendar, time management and have a reminder to be active. I used to wear it until i broke it in school, this shows how delicate an Apple Watch is, thats why I went with a g shock"
77,"Got an Apple Watch for my birthday and wasn't convinced before but it won me over. Has helped me improve my health enormously with its gentle reminders and now I just want to make sure I close the ""three rings"" everyday and love the Maps when travelling.. so simple to use and would highly recommend"
78,"Recently I finally got a apple watch to track my fitness.  I used to use fitbit smart watch, I love the apple watch for running and the ease to use strava, the added apps and notifications was a bonus, but running with out a phone a big plus and works straight away"
79,"Thank you apple watch, love it"
80,"I am able to keep a good fitness record.love the watch it has so many features, maps, sends messages through text and fb messenger, call and take phone calls, fitness app and so much more! Really love it as it acts as a little assistant and remind me everything. Need more battery life"
81,Well it is a smart watch and it does what it says. Nothing exciting. I got the gps model and you can read send texts... check weather.. answer calls.. track sleep.. tracks how many calories you burned... etc
82,battery life - is really below average. need to charge every day.
83,would not buy again.
84,"Really love it as it acts as a little assistant and remind me everything! I can receive phone calls and different notifications, sometimes i even forgot to bring my phone out as the watch is already enough.it can also help me to keep track with my exercise and diet, remind me to exercise more and eat healthier!"
85,"i love the watch it has so many features, maps, sends messages through text and fb messenger, call and take phone calls, fitness app and so much more!"
86,"its incredible how much this tiny watch can do while being so slim and cute! this is a must for anyone on the go, its easy to use"
87,I love my Apple Watch it dose everything sports to my steps and calories. It also is nice to look at and has that professional look to them. You can go on your calls txts emails and even photos which I love. The down fall is having to charge them all the time I barley use it due to that reason. I’m
88,"I can’t believe that’s how smart phones be on your wrist and do almost do everything like a computer. Apple Watch 3 is a true computer and phone and does everting I need include social media’s, messaging, calling and more. Showing me my health and heart rates and also reminds me to exercise and more. Amazing"
89,"It's not that I really needed this watch. In fact I could seriously live without it. But it's just a little bit of luxury that I think I deserve to be honest! I love how it syncs with ALL my Apple tech. It lasts a day and a half usually at least without charge. Love that you can listen to music, take calls, and text all without your phone with you."
90,my life is so much easier with my new best friend.it tells me everythingthe battery life is not the best but i can not complain about it at all.my whole life is in my watch.its so helpful that you can connected to your phone as well so you can see for yourself what you are doing throughout the day.
91,"Highly recommend anyone to have an Apple Watch.....I first got the series 2, then ended up giving it to my Mum and getting the series 3 so I could have 3G. I love being able to answer calls and texts on it. I use the time function everyday.....no more burnt meals! I love tracking my steps and heart rate when exercising and I love the GPS function when using maps. Love it!"
92,I have been an Apple user since 2011 and was a happy customer too. My understanding was that Apple thinks about the best experience for their customers and provides them with the most convenient products to use .I had been using Apple watch series 2 over a year and switched to Series 3 in February 2018. I got the Nike+ sport band version. Link - https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-nike/silver-aluminium-pure-platinum-black-sport-band?preSelect=false&product=MQKX2X/A&step=detail#
93,"I was happy with the product until I faced major skin rashes caused by the watch band.Four days ago when I was browsing YouTube, I was resting my face on my left wrist which had the watch on. Within watching couple of videos, I was shocked to notice that there were about 20-25 RED round spots on my left cheek. The blood clots resembled the circles on the watch band."
94,"My family members were worried looking at the state of my face. When the spots did not get any better even after 3 days, I consulted a doctor. He confirmed that it is contact dermatitis which was caused by the material used on the Nike band."
95,I am happy to share the pictures with Apple Team to let them know what this strap has done/can do to someone's face.I wonder what QA has gone into selecting this material/pattern combination for Apple watch Nike band.
96,"The watch is ok, working pretty fast, but battery drainage is fast too.It didn't meet my expectations, so I've returned it to apple strore in Brisbane. For sure it measure something but the accuracy is questionable. It could be small for a man, even 42mm type. The price is a plus. $500 for a good watch with gps. Nice!"
97,"While it does everything advertised it definitely has some drawbacks for me. The battery life is terrible (I get 12 hours), it doesn’t always pick up phone calls and I’ve developed a sore under where the face sits in the last week or 2. All that aside I do love it for the convenience of not having to carry a phone all the time and it’s definitely motivating to move more"
98,The impact that not taking my phone out of my pocket has had cannot be overstated. We all get annoying messages at inopportune times - this watch just allows a better flow with your productivity - a quick glance a tthe watch and things are done. Call people on your wrist! Have your watch give you directions! Such an amazing companion and a great indicator of where wearable tech is set to go.
99,Not only can you leave the mobile at home with this accessory you get to keep yourself accountable for your active goals! The overall technology is advanced and such a resourceful tool!! Best gift/purchase one could ask for with the different functions that this watch has to offer! Love it!
100,"Never saw the point but after having one I can’t live without it! Time, apps, notifications but most of all steps are just some of the great features. I find myself getting more competitive now that it counts my steps.I especially love that it checks your heart rate too"
101,"using it everyday and cannot wear my Daniel Wellington anymore! Love the design of it as it looks professional and stylish, great functions and easy to use, can even receive phone calls!!! one of the feature that I love it most is that it can track my exercise even i am under the water (I swim a lot)"
102,"Bought this because of a friend, really convenient as you do not need to get out ur phone when you want to check the time, long battery life although I charge it almost once a day, you can get to see your message and email more convenient and easy way, moreover it can also track you health which is really good for people doing gym"
103,"Battery is excellent and never runs out in a day.Don’t like the pink colour on the band but you can get new bands.Music control from the watch is great.Siri works in it so that’s convenient.Water resistant, but I have not tested that yet.It has a scratch from being bumped, but it’s had a few good knocks and nothing has really damaged it."
104,Bought this smart watch about 3 weeks ago and I love it! I love especially the cellular option were you don't need to have the phone near by to make and receive phone calls. The watch looks great and is priced reasonably compared to say a Fossil smart watch which I bought first but returned after  couple days as it was rubbish.
105,"A bursting screen on an apple watch when washing the dishes - clearly not a case of misuse. Sure, it was oit of warranty (by four months) but I was confident that we'd be offered a replacement given that it was clearly amanufacturing fault. Instead we were it would cost over $300 to get it repaired. So much for the Apple premium on customer service."
106,This was a gift from my husband and I have to say its a great little gadget.  Love the activity and fitness components and lets me track and compare what I'm doing each day.  Also great range and syncs with my phone so I don't always have to carry the phone around the office and still know what's going on with calls and emails !!
107,"I received my Apple Watch for Christmas 2017, and although I would never think of buying it for myself, I’m so happy I have one. The best thing about this watch is if I want to go out for walks / trips to the shops without taking my bag and large phone, I can wear my watch and still be able to send and receive calls and txts. Another great feature I love is when I’m using my gps on my phone whilst driving and wearing my watch, my watch will vibrate to notify me of every turn I need to take. It’s a great design and I love the interchangeable bands."
108,I bought Apple Watch 3. After using it I never have to buy another watch as it’s very convenient I can pay using my watch and track my exercise and  calories. I can see my calendar my emails very easily. I can use this even during swimming an amazing thing is that tracks your Heartbeat.
109,"I've received the Apple watch S.3 in July as a birthday gift. it is so nice and very practical especially when I compared with my last one Fitbit Alta, I am a busy mum with 2 young kids, my iPhone always left behind or in my bag when I am doing house work or out with my kids, I used to miss many phone calls as either I didn't hear it or my hand s is too busy with kids. Now I can answer or received a phone call without touching my phone which is great. I use my watch "" Mickey and Minnie Clocks"" to teach my kids time and they love it. since I got my watch, they are tapping on my watch to listen to  Mickey or Minnie telling the time and Good morning, Afternoon, Evening and Goodnight :) and they say to me...Good night Pal  :) :)Also, I need to silent my phone (actually should be turn off the phone)  when I am at work, with the caller display function on my watch, I can choose to answer the important phone calls"
110,Got given this as a birthday present and it’s so nice! It is fun and easy to use. It has a stylish look to it and the best thing is that it’s water proof! Yep! You can wear it in the shower (as long as you put the waterproof mode on) so I love it.
111,Love this watch has really been a game changer for my weight loss. Perfect motivation tracker. Can’t praise this product enough. Syncs perfectly with my iPhone and my polar chest strap. Receives texts and calls and works with so many apps. You won’t be disappointed best purchase I’ve ever made.
112,I love this Apple watch it’s great for fitness as it keeps track of your daily activity movement standing calories and it has all your contacts and messages on hand. I only gave it four stars because sometimes it is a bit hard to press the desired app or icon because the watch is small but it’s truly great and it’s waterproof as well.  It’s such a handy little phone to have on your wrist.
113,"Being a watch lover, I am always fascinated by how time pieces become a part of our modern lifestyle. I decided to try the Apple watch and see how it can improve my life. At the beginning we were inseparable. Footsteps were counted, heartbeats synced but then I slowly realised that I don't need a watch like that. I bought the watch to potentially replace the need to take my phone around (3G ready) but it couldn't. I could not use it to pay with Apple Pay because my bank did not support it, and it was just easier to whip out one's phone anyway. I feel it suits individuals with active lifestyles more and the battery life is decent, needing a charge only once every 1.5-2 days."
114,This apple watch is a constant reminder of your daily fitness goals and keeps you connected without your phone. The watch is very easy to navigate around and is quite robust. My only negative for this device is the battery life - you do need to charge it every day because the battery will not last for 2 days.
115,"It is a nice gadget for your everyday life. The watch is comfortable and stylish and goes with anytype of dress, formal etc. The battery is not so good as you dont bother to charge your watch as well when you have plenty of ther things to charge as well. Useless when its not chaged. Should add a better battery"
116,"I highly recommend this item for those who like to follow their fit progress. It shows you your burnt calories, exercises, and the best part...it motivates you to keep improving every week. Besides this, it offers you many of the things you are used to get from your mobile, such as music, texts and so on."
117,It works well and has great functionality. Good range of app coverage. I love personalising the face with photos or different colours. Having my calendar events on the screen it is absolute life saver. Keeps charge well. The only downside is how expensive the original bands are direct from Apple.
118,Great gadget it does what ever u ask just like the phone easy to wear easy to charge easy to put on and take off coujdnt live without this watch love the band it come with snd hsve s couple of bands u can change at any time alarm works gray colour is awesome
119,"No complaints whatsoever. It works well. I’ve never had any issues with it. It does everything it promises to do, and more. I purchased it as an upgrade, and it really is just that. It’s better, and I think it’s quicker too. I’m usually quite critical in my reviews, but this watch really doesn’t have any downsides."
120,"The series 3 best update is the water proof function, i can swim with it, and i will not miss any message and phone call.i can use it for answering the phone callI always to change the screen wall paper every weekI think i will use it for over 2 yesrs before buy a new model."
121,"Like all apple products i purchase, they have yet to dissapoint, yes i am an apple fan boy, but i wasnt always one. I vowed never to get an apple product, then i purchased my first macbook pro. I haven't looked back since."
122,"The apple watch is amazing, to be honest i havent turned my phone off silent mode since i bought it."
123,The only problem I have with this product is that you aren’t able to go on to safari. Over all though this Apple Watch is a big part of my life and I really love the Minnie and Mickey watch effect. It’s great. I really love that you can change the colour of the bands
124,I recently purchased a Apple Watch series 3. I wanted the watch because I’m pron to not hearing my phone. I now never miss a call there’s so many functions it’s like a mini phone for your wrist great for monitoring your fitness comes with beautiful watch faces many designs you just choose the one you like. I would definitely recommend getting a Apple Watch u don’t have to have ur ph constantly in your hand never miss a call very convenient thanks apple for another great product
125,"Yes i have a similar experience. The top is disintegrating for no good reason. At first little bits came off on the right side, then at the two top corners. And I have only had it for four months and never wore it under the shower or had water on it for any other reason. Neither do I use sunscreen oil or any other kind of skin lotion.I mainly wanted it for the phone function which no longer works properly. A great pity."
126,"This is probably the best smart watch on the market, especially with the phone function. It will be even better with the update coming soon so that you can use podcasts on it as well. I have used it every day since January and have gotten one small scratch on it. Great for reaching fitness goals"
127,"Very convenient to have. When you cannot look at your phone for messages and calls you just access them via the watch. Also, very handy for exercise. You can do for example indoor bike and use the watch to monitor you KJ burnt and your heart rate. Also, can help you relax with the breathing app."
128,It is already obvious that apple products are overrated. I cant really do too much on the watch. Still have to purchase mobile plans additional so the watch can function without wifi. You can live without it unless you are very techy kind of person. Although its good to be hands-free especially for moms with kids
129,"My watch was in perfect condition, it worked straight away and I love it !!!!The other accessories that were included were in great condition and placed neatly within the products box.I love the watch so much it was a really good price and I can use it for anything now. I use it daily:) Five stars from me!"
130,"I purchased the Apple Watch alongside my phone plan (I have the iPhone X) as it seemed like a must-have. From the short time I've used it, it seems like Apple has struck gold with the Series 3! Battery life is more than acceptable (lasts 2 days), it's water proof (must have considering a watch is likely to be exposed to severe weather and splashes) and the app selection is great compared to Fitbit."
131,"Pros:Cellular, music streaming (AirPods required for full functionality), waterproof, fast app load times (due to the upgraded processor) and an large app selection."
132,"Cons:In order to use cellular (without carrying your iPhone), you'll have to pay an extra $5 per month on top of your phone plan/Apple Music subscription."
133,"If you don't require cellular connectivity or use many apps, save some money and get the Series 1. Otherwise, the Series 3 is absolutely perfect!"
134,Ok I purchased my watch directly from Sydney apple store. Had lots of fun being served by a extremely helpful salesperson. My whole family was in for this and my wife’s iPhone X purchase. But to the watch..
135,"Waterproof it is. I have wanted it for when I’m in the shower on call, and yes it’s been able to alert me of a call. Water and the screen don’t do well. It removes the ability to touch and can press screen buttons for you... annoying if you are not careful."
136,My biggest Hang up is why I purchased it. Freedom from my phone..... yeah. No. Two different carriers since I purchased my red dot gsm and I cannot send a text message when I’m not near my phone..... why apple why!?! I can call out. Just my texts fail to send. And I am looking at the tower.... calls come and go but never a text... looking into this issue.
137,Battery.I generally get a full day out of this 18 hours with some time away from the phone and also in poor reception zones. Lead walls make it a little hard for Bluetooth to communicate to the phone some 40 meters away in internal building.
138,"Messages are best dictated to the phone and for the most part come out well , mostly correct. I have had some wild ones."
139,"Close your rings... oh now this is the fun part of the watch. Excercise. I’m not a big runner, no bears chase me so I don’t run. But trying to close your rings becomes a game all in its own. And if your always beating your rings the watch asks to make new goals. So you let it. And you will need to do more to close those rings. Love it!"
140,Alerts and other apps.Not much other than about 20 apps are worth it for the watch. Apple needs to really push this with developers and make this a better integrated experience. I look at my watch more than my phone. Some apps are just useless and buggy. Others time out due to not syncing with your phone... but wait I want to be free from my phone. Come on apple push for gsm linking to phone or data!
141,Feel and look. Wear this anyway you like change the band and you can then tell the watch (from your phone) what way it’s being worn and hand. That’s great.Bands. Pricy but I have always gone back to my Nike Black it’s best to wash and easy to flip on and off.
142,Music control.I use my watch to control my music everywhere. This has the best voice control for playlists and with the crown being volume control you can adjust all without ever fiddling with your phone. Skip pause etc all from your wrist. This makes it great when I’m relaxing at home working on my hobbies or have friends over and you want to change out your music or just lower the volume.
143,Now to share a really good reason to have this.A friend who brought one because He saw its merits with myself and another couple of colleagues has his life to be thankful for it! Sailing he had boat difficulties and the boat became flooded. He was able to call his wife from his iwatch who was able to send the lifesavers to him and his location from his iwatch. They took a while but he was safe.
144,Cashless purchaseI have a card linked to my iwatch just for this.. shout out to Bank Australia. It’s the best way to always have cash on you. And no if your watch comes off your skin it locks and no one can access your payments without your pin.
145,Would I buy this again knowing what it’s likeYes
146,Very food model and design and the looks which make is look so futuristic and sexy. I want to get all the series of the watches bveause they are the best watches I've all gotten.and the wifi option of the red dul spinner thing works so cool as well yep
147,"Really happy with my Apple Watch. Was surprise as a gift from my husband. It allows me to look at who’s call, reply back to text messages. If I want to go swimming no need to take this off. I highly recommend this Apple Watch.Has different band available and really easy to set up."
148,"Had the watch for 20 days the top glass came apart by just tapping the screen. Did not drop it.Please share if you had similar experience. Apple asking me if uses sunscreen or after shave or moisturer which I’m not but even if I do, does it really matter??"
149,"Beautiful, functional, intelligent watch. I don't know how I ever lived with out it and I don't even use a third of the functions. I can take phone calls any time - I never miss a call at work - even when I am away from my phone and desk - my watch just rings! I purchased this watch as I was sick of missing calls being away from my phone for 2 minutes. I also get sick of having to carry my phone everywhere - to the supermarket, a quick run t the petrol station. I text from my wrist, control apple music playlist and even have remote access to the camera on my phone. II can customise the screen face to my favourite photo or another pre chosen face. Features work amazing - like GPS,  apply pay, heart rate monitoring, sleep monitoring. HIGHLY reccommend."
150,"I would highly recommend this product if you have an iPhone. it is vey good and high tech. it has lots of useful features, including the ability to track your steps, tell you how much exercise you have done and how many calories you have burned. I like this and it is good."
151,I love being able to see when I am inactive - or rather I relish the reminder to get up and be active. Have had it for 6 months and have become childishly competitive in making sure I have been moving about enough over the day.
152,A super competitive partner helps.
153,It is a very good reliable smart watch with compatibility with a lot of apps. Best feature is ApplePay via the watch. The only downside is the battery life of the watch with constant used and calls. It would be nice if the battery last longer and that I do not have to charge it everyday to ensure its lifespan.
154,"Owned this piece of crap for 3 days and can’t even walk 50 feet away from my phone with out it not being able to send texts or calls. The whole reason I bought it was to not have my phone in my picket 24/7. It works great if the phone is in my pocket, other than that I wouldn’t waste your money on this device the way I had"
155,"Love it, would recommend to family and friends. Definitely worth the price, just wish the screen was scratch proof. Easy to use and incredibly convenient, would be lost without my Apple Watch.The band is a little uncomfortable and cheap but other than that I love love love love it"
156,"It's best to think of the Apple Watch in distinct generations, so far. Bought it for my partner who loves watch and I must say she is loving it. She is someone who forgets her phone anywhere, and with this technology She doesn't need to worry about leaving her phone at home while she goes out. ✌️"
157,"Connects and syncs perfectly with other Apple devices. The features I mostly use are shopping lists, calendars, traffic information and controlling music played on Bluetooth speakers from the watch. Find my phone pinging option is also very handy! It’s unfortunate that it’s not the best looking smart watch on the market."
158,"I love my Apple Watch series 3! My partner bought it as a Christmas present for me as I couldn't stop talking about how much I wanted one! We got the Cellular version, especially since I go for runs it's very convenient to be able to call someone in the case of an emergency and not have to bring my phone with me, as it's connected to your network provider and your phone number (Vodafone, Optus) as opposed to just bluetooth- this means you can be miles away from your phone, and you can still call from your apple watch! There are plenty of apps that utilise this watches abilities, and it performs well under water! My only complaint would be its battery life! I find even if its just on my wrist not being used much except for tracking steps/calories/checking time, the battery dies after about 1 day and a half, I'd love for it to have 2-3 days worth of battery abilities! Otherwise, its a master creation and the future looks bright for wearable tech. You can buy any band that's made for the watch itself (even some cheap ones off eBay, they work just fine) and be able to change the entire look of the watch! Very very happy :)"
159,It is a decent smartwatch and its primary use is to sync up with your iPhone and provide a quicker interface and less clutter to check your daily notifications that include texts and emails. Very useful when exercising or driving as you can quickly glance at it to know why it beeped. Only complaint would be the poor battery life compared to my old fitbit or my friends samsung watch.
160,"Love the apple watch and features. Payway, waterproof, tells the time.interchangeable bands from ebay are great for a fresh look every month if that's what you're into.Not keen on the battery life. Having come from fitbit where battery life is 5-7 days between charging to 1-2 days for a charge is a little disappointing."
161,This is my first smart watch and I absolutely love it! Being able to answer calls and text messages without having to pull my phone out is great! I love being able to track my exercise too. Reminders to breathe and stand up throughout the day are having a posture impact on my wellness. The watch itself is very comfortable to wear. I got the bigger screen and find its size perfect!
162,"I purchased my APPLE WATCH SERIES 3 as I own IPHONE and it is so convenient to get quick access to who's calling me, texting,emails, & while on the road or attending to clients as no need to pick up my phone.I am a very happy customer as this watch is definitely good value."
163,Brought it so I wouldn’t have to look at my iPhone and it sure did the work. Also I didn’t get the internet one mainly because I can simply use my own iPhone as a hot spot anyway since I’ll have my iPhone in my pocket no matter what. It’s a habit that I’ll never leave behind. Also the good thing is that I can find where’s my iPhone if I loose it so long I’m wearing the watch on.
164,"This wearable watch is excellent, the best I have ever own. It has some of the best features I link it to my Apple iPhone which makes it easy for me to send and receive notifications and messages on the go. I am happy to recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a watch/wearable device!"
165,Bought an Apple watch 3 for my wife and myself. Mine has been great. My wife's was great for 6 months and then two dots like little blisters appeared under the heart monitoring lights. She is fastidious at cleaning her watch with a microcloth. Apple claim it is due to an allergy that is not their fault. They can't explain why this occurs just under the two lights given that the back of the Apple watch 3 is completely flat. They won't give us a refund or replace the watch. For a watch that costs over $500 I would say don't buy one as you are taking a risk on losing your money and having a product you can't use.
166,"I bought this product with the belief in mind that I will find this useful for checking my information on the go, however I have not found a circumstance where I can believe that this watch is actually useful. Everytime I have used this product I ended up using my phone anyway."
167,"Got watch for birthday, 10 days later I noticed a small hole on the top left hand corner and it was cracked around 2 sides. I hadn’t dropped it and I don’t recall knocking it on anything. A watch should be able to withstand normal daily activity. Apple charged $405 to replace it as they deemed it damaged. Since this I have read lots of other reviews for the same issue. At some point Apple need to accept that their quality/design is poor. I will not be buying Apple products moving forward as this is unacceptable, especially for such an expensive watch."
