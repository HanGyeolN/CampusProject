0,"Great washing machine.  Have been using it for almost a year without any problem. Cleans well and has many functions like soak, delicate wash, quick wash, quiet wash, tub clean and air dry.  The glass top lid gives it a great look and it is not too noisy.   Since it is agitator-less, it can accommodate more clothes and feels more than 6.5 kg capacity.   It is big enough for our family of four (2 adults and 2 children)."
1,Gave one star because I couldn't find '-' or '0' star. after so many complaints about lint filter not working well how come company still selling this product in the market. I feel like i bought this machine to ruin my clothes. I am stuck with this machine bcoz I've  paid $1000 and tried to sale it online but the resale value is just $300. What a shame!!!
2,"Every couples of years I need to replace a washing machine, when I bought LG washing machine from a retailer in 2009 to now is about 10 years time I still use it."
3,Machine 1 year old and it damages clothes- stretches it and leaves lint on half load.
4,"What is even more of a headache is the LG customer service (offshore) - the most terrible customer service i've ever received- inconsistent, lacks care, poor communication. Called over 12+ times, constantly following up before I am able to get a technician."
5,"For a 7.5kg machine, i put 3 kgs (less than half a load) in and maximum water, they advised I am overloading machine and i need to use more water- what a joke for a 4 star water efficiency!"
6,"Their definition of ""troubleshoot"" is put clothing in bags and don't overload."
7,I have lost trust in the brand and quality of customer service. Never again LG. Life is not good!
8,"I do 2 washes a week on average; for one person (me!). One load with bed sheets, 1 towel and hand towel and floor mat, the other is office/gym clothes that are not really soiled but some black work pants/skirts. Rarely do I have a wash that I don't have to remove lint. I have one short-haired cat that does not shed much fur. Not dogs, no excessively fluffy clothes!! White sheets can come out with brown lint stains over them, meaning I have to put them through a cycle again. I pay for water where I live so this is not economical. The wash cycle I choose is the default wash not the quick cycle as at least this default cycle spins the clothes to be dryer. But it takes quite a long time. I am totally dissatisfied with this machine. Most major parts have been replaced due to faults in the operating when it was barely 1 year old. Mostly the OE error. Finding the lint filter is a nightmare. The machine can end up with an OE error and an incomplete wash cycle and you can't do a thing about it. Manually rinse and wring out the clothes!!!. I read this OE is the filter is clogged but every time a technician has been out, it is ""clean as a whistle"". So they replaced the motherboard. Next time the struts needed replacing, something the LG technician said happens on a machine nearly 10 years, not 2 years old. Recently it flooded and the OE error again. Incomplete wash and 6 towels to mop up the laundry and dining room inundation. Thank god I have tiles. Technician from LG, who was quite rude to me, said he ""could not replicate the error but would replace the pump"". Yesterday the spin function stopped working. Another OE error. More hand wringing. All the time I am asking for a refund because this product does not meet consumer expectations that it should wash your clothes and not keep failing. I have been told I have to use the 3 hours of super-heated water Tub Clean cycle (more water and electricity usage) once a month and put vinegar in the water to ""break down the lint"", and use de-scaler product to ""break down the lint"", and put the liquid OMO (the highest  rated product) into a cup of hot water before using it to reduce lint. 10 years with a Fisher and Paykel and never had to do any of those things. I have NEVER used fabric softener. But what if people choose to? LG don't recommend it as it encourages lint. The LG support centre refuses to give me a contact for LG Australia to communicate with. I have been told ""if it can be fixed, it won't be replaced"". Every time I call LG with a problem, they tell me ""but madam, you have only called us once before"" so they do not keep a track of all the times this machine has failed. I have had to ask them to consolidate all call records. So I have an 8.5kg machine with very little demand on it's fundamental design (to wash clothes) and it fails my expectations. It is only just 3 years old. I see LG not backing up their reputation by authorising a refund on what is very obviously the worst washing machine I have ever used (and many others after reading this web site). I am going back to F&P or Simpson. In short, LG needs to step up and look after customers. Very, very disappointed."
9,"I purchased my LG Washing Machine after my Fisher and Paykel of 20 years finally stopped working.  I did quite a bit of research  and both LG and F & P came up as very good products.  Whilst I may have preferred the F & P, I was limited by the lid opening space I had to my Wall Dryer hence the purchase of the LG."
10,"To date I have been quite happy with this appliance.  I read other reviews where people complained of the clothes being twisted and tangled and yes this does happen but as I usually hang my clothes on the line, it doesn't take much to untangle them.  It would probably be more annoying if you were putting them in the dryer."
11,"I find it washes the towels very clean (as good as if not better than my old F & P) on the towel cycle.  It doesn't seem to be too hard on our clothes.  I always do a cotton wash cycle.  To date I haven't really used any of the other options except a quick wash which is good for smaller loads.  On average the time for a wash is anywhere between an hour and an hour and fifteen mins and that is with a full load.  I am quite happy with no agitator in the middle of the machine and I do like the see through, soft close lid."
12,"I have had a problem on at least 6 occasions of the machine indicating there was a problem with the lid closing (code ""de"").  I have to wipe the contact points a couple of times to get the machine to start, so I don't know whether it is using washing powder vs washing liquid that causes the problem or it is a defect with the machine and other users have that problem too.  I have not rung LG yet to discuss this issue so I can't comment on what help I will receive from them but I will ring next time it happens."
13,Overall I am very happy with this product which not only performs to my satisfaction but looks good in the laundry as well.
14,"The machine has more high tech functions that will provide almost any wash combinations possible, Great value at the price and the warranty service is very good. But to start the machine the high tech self start packed in the first day and after repairs continues to malfunction. It is a technical issue that can't be solved as the item is way to over complicated. So when you get the error report tap the right side of the machine near the top and it works."
15,"I bought the LG 8.5 kg Top Loader washing machine, I had problems with the machine leaking water after the washing cycle is finished the machine keeps leaking water inside the drum, the inlet valve needs replacing it only lasted 2.5 years.I'm really disappointed with LG Washing machines and don't recommend it for anyone."
16,"Have been unsatisfied with this product and the way it washes. Swishes from side to side, barely cleaning any of our clothes. Detergent left on clothing (even when we have triple checked amounts used). Lint on every wash regardless of tub clean or filter clean. Have tried everything to fix from our end and no luck. Customer service gives same advice but it's obviously just the machine. Family members with same machine have experienced this also. Waiting for it to die and then never buying an LG again!"
17,Summary of the above washing machine purchased February 2018:-
18,LG's Selling points:-
19,"1) Big size, 9.5kg2) Programs are way too long.3) Supposed to allows us to wash quilt, blankets and pillows with ease4) See through glass on the top to see what’s happening3) Option to stop the machine to add items that you forgot to added in during washing4) Supposed to have advanced computerised operating options. To customise how you want the washing completed, including the number of rinse cycle, level of water, minutes of washing...etc which I thought was a great idea at the time of purchase5) The extra spin cycle gets clothes really dry, so less time needed to get the clothes to dry completely under the sun or in the dryer"
20,Negative points:-
21,"1) Large size, takes up room in your laundry space2) Hard to reach the bottom of the machine unless you have very long arms and I’m 5'7""3) The wash programs are way too long, 2 Hours for towels?  1.5 Hours for Eco Cotton? This is supposed to be a water saving and economic machine.  Not with wash cycles of this length.   The cycle’s programmes being too long which costs more electricity4) Fast Wash only does a light spin and leaves the clothes too wet to put into the dryer so you need to do an extra spin.5) Being a large machine, I have found with this machine I constantly had to check how much water the machine had put in as a lot of time there was not enough water to cover the clothes.  If you only have a small load of washing, you need to use Eco Cotton if you intend to use your dryer otherwise you either have to an extra spin on fast wash as the clothes are too wet to dry in a drier.  Despite being able to adjust the water level, you are still ended up using quite a lot of water, as you need the water level to be high enough to cover the clothes6) With the water level issues it is not a machine you can set and walk away as you have to keep coming back to check it has correctly done what it was programmed to do and is washing correctly.7)  DO NOT WASH DOONA'S DUVETS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.  I believe this machine has a design fault, and when I washed one recently which was under the 9.5kg load for this machine.  The doona floated up during the spin cycle and got caught somehow.  The machine sounded like a car doing a burn out and was extremely loud.  The machine melted the plastic top of the machine above the stainless steel bowl and there was a strong smell of burning, and there is no safety cut out designed into this machine if an item of clothing gets above the water level. This is a fire hazard and just not safe."
22,"LG currently refused a warranty claim which is still in dispute and which I do not agree with.  They claim if you wash sheets or doona's in this machine and they quote from the Washing Machine Manual that the items have to be in a bag or netting because the item may float up.  Tell me where you can buy one of those? Also if you need to put an article of clothing into a bag, isn't that to protect the clothes and not the machine?  If that's needed why are they not supplied with this machine on purchase or an option to purchase?  Also if they have this instruction in the manual and say that an item ""may float"" then they are aware there is a design fault in this machine."
23,"LG's service technician’s inspection of my machine in regards to the warranty claim was to lift the lid.  That's it no other inspection.  They then took pictures of the damage, attempted to accuse me of washing something that the machine was not designed for this is how they assessed my warranty claim from that inspection."
24,"When LG were asked why this machine had no safety feature to stop the machine if an article of clothing goes above the water level, LG has no sensible answer. This machine is supposed to be an intelligent machine with SmartQ."
25,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!  I personally think it has a design fault and LG know this, FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT’S A FIRE HAZARD."
26,I would not recommend this machine to my worst enemy and I certainly would not ever consider another LG product especially after this experience and the attitude and treatment by LG.
27,Not overly impressed with this machine. The wash cycle takes forever. I have had multiple issues with the machine clogging up because of dog hair/fluff in the filter which took me forever to work out why the machine would simply turn itself off mid wash and full of water. Technicians were no help. I worked it out myself. Now I know I have to regularly pull plug out the back to remove any buildup which then fills the laundry with the water that is in the machine after the drain cycle. Not happy with the quality of the clothes that come out at the end of the cycle. I only have rain water which is put through filters so my water quality is excellent. I would much rather use an old twin tub than this shiny new expensive waste of money.
28,"Negatives are just too numerous. VERY LONG wash cycles, no manual programming for shorter cycles. Power outage means one hell of a headache to resume/finish that cycle, twists and tangles everything throwing it out of balance and no safety out of balance stop. No soft close lid anymore just slams shut, very noisy and rattly.Controls at front never have been a good idea on any appliance.Never had an LG anything before this and an LG fridge bought at same time.(also crap) and will not ever have anything LG again."
29,I bought a LG top loader as my daughter had one for over ten years and it was brilliant. This machine regularly doesn’t allow hot water in. Repair man said it was because our hot water was too hot or pressure too great!!  Suggested we purchase a hot water regulator
30,"I put day to day clothes all fabric types, kids, hi vis work clothesEasy to use, settings and functions, i use a variety of the options and cyclesGentle on delicatesIf i need to do a quick or longer cycle i have the optionI am pleased with the overall performance of the product"
31,We wanted this machine for quite a while before finally buying it. Its great - it cleans so very thoroughly and spins out very dry for a top loader. I love the clear lid - I can see whats going on and adjust as necessary. It almost never goes off balance like my old one and looks good as well
32,"Bought my washing machine based on the fact it has no agatater which  allows for easy loading of clothes & less creasing on completion of wash . I have done a queen size Dooner  in it with very good results . so happy I made this wise purchase ,& would recommend it to all my friends"
33,"I purchased an LG washing machine 10kg over 10 years ago and I have had no problems with it since. LG may generally be slightly more expensive than other brands, but in my opinion a wise choice, I used to be a fischer and paykel on all brands but having an LG clothes washer for so long with so many different settings although I only use one setting and just let it run. It runs for just under an hour and I find that it cleans my clothes, towels, blankets etc,  sanitises and conditions them and spin dries them very well and  when they are hung out to dry, dry in a very short span of time.For convenience the large 10kb capacity allows me to simply load my machine with general everyday items of a weekly wash for 2 persons and the wash is done in just under an hour.I have never washed my good clothes and delicates preferring to hand wash although there are several settings on my machine for this together with soaking. I just never trust machines to perform those tasks preferring to always hand wash since my very first washing machine, I think it was a singer wringer tub back in the 60's.So Kudo's to LG for an amazing reliable washing machine."
34,After pulling out my hair with our Simpson for years I finally decided to try this machine and haven't looked back since. It is super easy to use and oh so quiet.I think our clothes are finally getting a decent wash too. LG have a customer for life if it keeps going the way it is.
35,"we have had this machine for 2 years - not really happy with water use  - HATE the fact it ties clothes up into knots - then the PUMP STOPS WORKING.....a few days of trying to problem solve, a few more trying to work through the LG support service....3 times now i have had to ""Bail out"" the drum of water i cant get out any other way - Buying a F&P - never again - feel bad for the environment that 2 years it is crap, but cant go any longer going to laundromat to get washing done!!!"
36,We purchased this as I didn’t want a front loader and so far so good.
37,I find there is a lot of washing options which is great and it takes loads of clothes. The only thing I would say is that it is a touch louder than a front loader but only marginally.
38,So far very happy
39,"We got the Direct Drive 7.5 top loader, it is very high tech so took us a few test loads to work how to get the optimal water level, but once we know the setting we're after it is much better than our previous top loader/front loader washing machines.1 This clean and rinse well.  you have to choose wash at least 10 minutes if you have a big load.2 we only got it around 2 month so can't tell if it wears out cloth3 we live in a unit with laundry in the bathroom, and this machine is quiet enough (even in spin cycle) for us to sleep in the morning so Yes  it is quiet.  (when you pick washing machines at the store you can try to shake the drum, the support mechanism for this drum is very good so it is hard to move, which means the drum spins in the middle instead of hitting the side of the washer.4. Don't have a favorite feature, just like the quietness of the washer  :)"
40,I got extended warranty at Bing Lee as well so i am all good.
41,"This machine is the worst ever. It leaves cloths more dirty than you put them in. Covered in lint, fluff and scrud. For which LG suggests your run a clean tub program of 3 hours every 10 washes or so. If only it worked/helped. It does not. And that is after LG replaced the motherboard as the machine before destroyed cloths by twisting them together and tearing them apart. The Worst Ever."
42,We're not a fan of LG products but we bought this cloths washer because it was on sale and had a nice display panel. Loads of cloth options and also huge amount of room for super large baggy cloths or bed sheets and blankets or if like us you have a large family it takes a huge load.
43,"I was a bit sceptical when I was about to purchase this as I just had a LG issue with a purchase - a different company prior to that. Now,  I am loving it as I was previously using the old model of the same product which just got broken - have lasted for a long time though."
44,"This attractive looking machine stands proudly in the store with a great big stick on its front stating its fantastic for lint removal. Um, yeah not its not. Nicce to look at, reasonably quiet and has most cycles and features you'd expect from a washing machine designed for a big family. On the downside not only is it crap at removing lint with its monstrous size lint filters, but im starting to think it might actually have a secret lint making compartment. You'll  never wear black again."
45,"Works very well, it is very gentle on clothes, I like the easy cleanable lint catchers, I also like the fact that while the machine is filling you can add detergent etc. the only issue is the programming which I think is bit complicated. The machine runs very quietly that is good."
46,Had initial problems setting up the wifi feature as I couldn't find the password. LG took 4 days to get back to me with someone who knew what to do. My current problem is that it doesn't drain at the conclusion of a delicates cycle - am waiting for LG to get back to me a solution. Another problem is that despite the booklet saying you can set the soak time the machine seems to only do 30 mins - absolutely useless for baby clothes. I feel like it has less functions than my old Fisher and Paykel but there is nothing I can do about that!
47,So 3 weeks later I'm still waiting for LG to sort out this machine. A technician has been out and said it wont drain after the delicates cycle and to get it to empty I need to run another cycle - not happy! What a waste of my electricity and water!
48,So the soak - one technician advised just to do the load several times until the washing is clean. Totally defeats the purpose if it going to drain out the soaking solution. Still waiting (with a load of baby clothes waiting to be washed in the machine)!!
49,Technicians advise they will call by a set time - simply doesn't happen. This has happened numerous times and is very frustrating!!
50,"I'm in love with my new LG its stylish yet perfectly compact for my little laundry and smart. Ive never seen a washing machine spin as fast and as quiet as this, not waking my kids anymore i'm back to doing my washing of a night again. Awesome yet again LG."
51,"This washer does do a good job and clothes are cleaned well, but the big disadvantage for us living on tank water is that it weighs the load before it decides how much water to use. This means that any wet clothes that you might have had soaking, or very damp towels, make it use more water. It also means that you can't tip in buckets of water collected as the shower heats up.  You can adjust it to a manual wash but I have to get the manual out every time to do this. Plus it makes you do a tub clean occasionally which uses water. I just wish it didn't decide water usage on its own."
52,Bought this machine 2 January this year and am nothing but problems with lint deposited on everything.
53,"I can wash say towels one day, and even 3 washes later, lint from towels is deposited on my clothes."
54,"LG want me to pay to have a tech come out and inspect the machine and if it is faulty, they will give me a remedy."
55,"I refused - told them that if there was no manufacturing defect, then it proves the machine is crap - and I will take it back to the store and say it's not fit for purpose and get a refund."
56,"This may turn out to be a long process, but judging from comments here, I'm not alone with a lint problem so it's an issue and LG would be aware of it."
57,This top loading machine is performing well and very quiet. It has many water levels  and washing cycles to choose. The normal cycle is very long so I ussualy chose the quick wash. One problem with the machine is that the machine is very deep you have to make sure that you are comfortable to reach the cloths at the end before you buy the machine.
58,As per Zoso I also called to have my machine's glass lid fixed under warranty and was told I had misused the washer. I called Consumer Affairs who said the words 'safe' and 'durable'. Their glass lids are clearly not durable!. I will continue my demand for a free replacement. I rated this company policy as 'terrible' but the machine itself is in my opinion excellent.
59,To get the only negative out of the way quickly unless you are over 170cm tall it is hard to reach the bottom of the wash tub.However positives are that there is no agitator so it can take large items like pillows or duvets reasonably easily and do a good cleaning job. Lots of functions which are easy to set and change to your requirements.I like the clear glass lid so you can see what is going on.After having had a F&P for 15 years I was anxious changing brands but to this point in time no complaints.
60,"Really happy with this purchase. Very quiet and has a glass lid that you can see through. Auto weighs the load and selects the water level (you can adjust it if you need to). You can also add items in after its started which is really handy. I like that it doesn't have an agitator, and haven't had any problems at all with clothes getting tangled up (I do use a lingerie bag for stockings and other delicates though). I find it a little bit small to be able to fit a queen size doona cover plus a full queen sheet set and pillowcases all together in one load. Otherwise very happy with the 7.5kg size. Very happy with the way the clothes come out. Clean, no stains from any build up etc. I'd happily recommend to friends and family."
61,"Washes ok, not particularly good or bad. Does seem to leave lint all over the clothes and doesn't leave them very dry after the spin cycle. The machine also can leak if not set to the right angle (not actually level) as spray during the rinse cycle can bounce off drum and down the inside of the machine on to the floor. Most disappointed to discover that the manual cautions you to never wash any waterproof or water resistant items in the machine. So no parkas, mattress protectors, ski clothing ... Pretty useless."
62,Rinse and dry clothes perfectlyLess wrinkles on clothesIt's relatively loud when rinsingVery engery efficientPerfect size for one big loadClothes do not wear out at allIt has all little functions like you can choose or adjust water level depending on how big your load is;  easy adjusting time ; many options for washing;
63,"I have had MANY washing machines over my life- this is the most expensive and the WORST!-- Does NOT wash cleanly, leaves lint all over clothes, does NOT go through spin cycle,- off balance! NO short- quick cycle. 55 mins, and only allows low water level. Disgraceful!! Also- bowl too deep for normal people!AND- twists clothes up- I cannot afford another machine- I am stuck with this!!it does not allow for manual override of settings, so there is NO control of this machine.I have to stay close by to watch - as spin cycle stops, and starts filling water again, which is not good, especially on tank water.sometimes 1 load of washing can take 2-3 hours!! This is SO frustrating and disappointing!!!"
64,This machine is fantastic. Cleans clothes beautifully without tangling them.  Also very quiet to run.  The only issue I have is the length of the cycles.  I have had an LG prior to this one and decided they are such good machines that I would purchase only LG this time.
65,Recommended tub cleans 5 hours! Filter at the back on bottom of machine. Lint on clothes! Worst machine ever. LG spokesman said they could send me some troubleshooting ideas! Very disappointed. Would never recommend this machine to anyone. Even the cycles go fircway too long ... never again.
66,"A sturdy washing machine that cleans and rinse well! We wash our clothes and baby clothes separately. So far, everything has been holding up well. In terms of loudness, it is as loud/quiet as any other washing machine, I think. However, there are times when we wish the wash cycle can be quicker because time management is so important with newborns in the family."
67,Tangles clothes and covers everything in lint and doesnt clean well at all never puts enough water in hard to reach the bottom of machine and the stupid lint filter is at the back so u have to pull the whole machine out to get at it impossible by myselfregret buying this machine
68,Filter on bottom back of machine making it hard to get to. Even after cleaning filter clothes are still covered in fluff. When washing clothes it hardly even moves so I don’t think they are getting washed properly. Going back to a front loader. A lot easier to use and get a cleaner wash with no fluff.
69,"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this washing machine!"
70,"After seven years of despising my front loader, I was adamant that when the piece of junk finally died I would return to a top loader. Having no experience with a top loader with no agitator, I wasn’t too sure what to expect. However, so far I am stoked with the results. My clothes haven’t felt this clean in years. It evens cleans smelly old dog blankets to the point that there isn’t so much as a whiff of that gross doggy smell. The capacity is also large enough to handle queen sized doonas without any dramas."
71,This machine is quiet enough that I can do loads at any time of the day or night without disturbing anyone (important when you like to wash at midnight and live in an apartment complex). The song that plays at the end of a load is also relatively quiet and only plays once (a big plus for me).
72,My only gripe is that there is no wool cycle which is annoying as hell but that was my bad for not paying attention to the various cycles in the specifications. I simply just wash my woollens on a warm cycle without the rinse cycle and then hand rinse in warm water.
73,"Also, to the people who have experienced tangling, I would suggest increasing the water level on the load. I have only ever experienced tangling when I’ve tried to be stingy with the water levels. When I am a little more generous with said levels, I don’t get the tangles."
74,"As always, Appliances Online made for a fantastic buying experience."
75,It’s top-lead washing machine.We used to front-door washign machine but it wasn’t cleaner than top-lead washing machine.It’s quite quick and we can get quite nice result.I just used to use standard course (cotton and quick)It’s not loud and it doesn’t disturb my other tasks.It’s capacity is 9.5kg so we can wash our blankets and a lot of laundry.I think our family love this washing machine.
76,"The slow release lip function is great. It is quiet and clean. The circular hard filters are also easy to clean. It is also very gentle on the clothes by using the right cycle. However it is still a bit too small to wash the big blanket, I wish I have bought the 9.5kg model."
77,"This washing machine is alright, quiet, and perfect for small family. It has a control panel which allows you to select your mode easily. Even for the water level, so you can save some water when required and when you are washing less clothes. Price is reasonable around 700 AUD."
78,I love this machine. Especially that there is no agitator clothes don’t get tangled around the agitator because there is none! But it cleans everything really well love the turbo air drying it’s great in winter. Also love that there are no messy filters to clean and it lets me know when I am due to do a tub clean which takes a while so my advice is to let it do it over night or on a day your not going to be washing.
79,"clear cover，less noise than my previous one. Not clean well, but reasonable. some clothes I have to sork it and hand cleaning. One thing I don’t like it, when I chose cold water only, the system still go hot water and cold water.over all , the machine is functional, I paid 500 aus dollars for it."
80,I have owned 2 LG top loaders. It's working well after 5 years and I absolutely love the quick wash fuction which only takes 30 minutes. And I used the quick wash a lot because I have a little one why I do the washing in a daily basis. Highly recommended
81,"This machine is not loud, and it does a good job cleaning my clothes. Drying is average. It is quiet and I forget that it is on. Which is not a problem because it turns off automatically after washes. The only down side is that it takes awhile to weigh the clothes"
82,This washing machine looks good and is very quit. Doesn’t jump around like my old one. Not having an agitator is fabulous for washing duvets however on some of the linger cycles certainly tangle the clothes eve though we were advised that this didn’t happen. Majority of the cycles are really long and the quick cycle whilst only just over half an hour only allows for a low water level limiting the items.
83,"I enjoy the slow release lid and the glass top.It washes well and the circlular hard filters are easy to remove, clean and have done well catching lint.The limit of wash choices is frustrating and the lid cannot be up whilst the water is filling which I liked from previous model.Our appliance had damage on the side from warehouse movement which we were unaware of until opening. We live hours from the shop and therefore either party were willing to pay returns. I would reccommend more packaging inside the box to prevent damage."
84,Wash’s great need to use quick wash as the Cotten wash takes over 2 hours. It’s very quiet and only beeps a short time when finished. I love the extra air dry feature so your clothes don’t take a long time to dry. I love that you can fit a large blanket in it and it will be washed
85,"Ok, so all washing machines work until they don't, right? Well this machine is no different, was great at washing clothes until it stopped working at 16 months old. What followed was the most harrowing experience of my consumer life, and is still not resolved."
86,"LG customer service is non existent. Worse than non existent, because it masquerades as a service. You will be able to speak to someone, they will follow a script perfectly acting as if they would like (and are able to) help you, however they and LG couldn't give a fig about repairing and subsequently replacing/refunding the machine."
87,"We have been waiting for almost 6 weeks now. Have had had no calls returned as promised, always having to call LG, and re-explain the situation. We have had to take off 5 separate days from work to wait for the service technicians. We have had LG order the wrong parts, lie to us and hang up on us when we were asking (ok probably demanding by the end) for them to either fix the machine, or replace it, or give us our money back so that we could buy another."
88,Instead we have been left in a pityless limbo with mounting piles of laundry and no help in sight.
89,"To summarise, avoid like the plague. These things will break eventually, even the $$ Bosch/F&P do, but if you can afford an extra $100 or two DO IT! Customer service is worth it. (My colleague had her Bosch break at the same time (2.5yr old machine) it was assessed and replaced all within 1 week.)"
90,"My suggestion AVOID. If you have one, call as soon as you have a problem, dont wait!"
91,"UPDATE:I sent through the ACCC letter of complaint and voila LG inform us that they have 'approved' for the Good Guys to provide us with store credit, waiting now to hear for how much. 24-48hrs."
92,"As soon as I bought lg washing machine and got installed, 24hrs later had a phone call from lg that the particular model needs an update service.. Why? It's brand new?! They came down and said needed to be adjust cause water gage didn't work properly! It seems to be sorted then I had my first wash and realised the machine did not clean my clothes.. I had make up on my top which (is water based) it normally gets clean from my old machine but twice went through this lg machine and both times it came out still dirty. Hand wash got it out immediately.. I've never hand wash until I got this lg machine. My baby had urine on the sheets and the machine did not wash it out. Hand washing again was more effective. I called up regarding the machine but got refused the warranty cause the machine is not faulty! Numerous times on call waiting from the Good guys, all of them told me to call up lg. I'm so upset spending this type of money and getting nothing in return. I'll never buy lg brand machine again ever! I'll never shop from The Good guys either! Fast to take your money but no help whatsoever."
93,I love this machine. It looks awesome and it washes so well. Very quiet and I love there is nothing in the middle of the barrel like old machines used to have so nothing gets caught and tangled. I am sure this is much gentler on your clothes too. I am impressed with the LG brand of products.
94,"Had it five months stopped spinning and rinsing took four weeks to get fixed , worked for three days and started doing it again, wont fill with water wont rinse wont spin. Never again LG Keeps saying hose is blocked starts a cycle and gets to 38 minutes and just keeps pumping, substandard machine."
95,"I bought this machine with high hopes and it started out ok. About 8 months into owning the machine I have had it repaired 3-4 times. The machine tub became loose somehow, and is super loud, and bangs around so much that it moves almost a metre away from the wall. The machine has now scratched sides from hitting the laundry tub whilst spinning violently. The repair guy has tried to resolve this problem twice already. It then also got the occasional error codes that it was not draining well, and a part needed replacing. Then after those repairs, the sensor immediately stopped working properly and would only land the water level at 1. So to wash a load properly I would need to stand by the machine, check its levels, and check in whilst draining and spinning to make sure the machine washed and stayed in place. Not really a justifiable use of time when I have kids and work!Now I'm being told the whole computer board needs replacing.Really!! I think I deserve a new replacement as 8 months with all of these problems, just means its a bad faulty machine!! Not happy LG..."
96,"Update: computer board was replaced, and the next day the same problems are happening. Machine sensor doesn't work. Very loud spin cycles with tub constantly loosening and machine moving roughly. I called LG explaining problems and asking for a refund, and I was told it would be brought to the attention of the manager and my call would be returned same day. One week later I'm still waiting for that call.I think its time to take consumer affairs action!"
97,"First wash took forever, just for towels 1hr 50min? Second wash I used the quick cycle and went out for a walk only to find when I got back it had stopped for unknown reason. Turned off and back on and it restarted. I have a weeks worth of washing to catch up on from having no machine and each cycle seems way too long plus twice it hasn't seemed to have added enough water and the instructions say you may have to adjust this.  What a pain!  They are quite deep and as a short person I find it hard to reach the items on the bottom. On the plus side, the clothes come out very soft, seems to use less water and detergent. I am getting used to the settings but the manual is not very good at explaining how to set your own wash so it has been trial and error. I hated in on day 1 but have since decided I do like not having an agitator in the way and we are making friends slowly!  You can fit lots in. The water level is a pain, as on occasion it doesn't seem to have filled enough. Takes some getting used to but I think I like it now and really happy with the softness of the clothes. Its very quiet, and I haven't even used the quiet cycle yet. Soft close lid is great."
98,"Clothes come out clean,  well rinsed out. Never damaged any clothes. Has a gentle cycle and quick wash. Really great washing machine. I have always been happy with this machine. Never had any faults or problems. I like how you have so many choices to wash with as well as the glass top to look on whilst its cleaning."
99,"The washing machine is a superb cleaner and the spin some times makes the clothes so dry that just in few hours its all ready to be kept in the wardrobe , my daughter likes the music at the end. she will walk around around the final rinse to hear it at the end . We have finally found what we needed in this master piece."
100,"It does not wash properly, often lint on everything. Clothes are not clean if they end up with more lint than when they went into the wash!!It shows an EO error that the filter needs clearing but you cant get to the filter....what is the point of that? 2nd service visit and I want to hear WHY this machine has so many problems (eg no unbalanced load error - just banging the bowl against the machine casing!. The lid inconsistently locks (it should) or not, the computer board was completey replaced at 12 months. I am very unhappy with this machine."
101,"It cleans Well and does not wear out or Damage any clothes, can be quite loud at times and it has the quick wash function which is handy, Favorite feature is that you can add on more by just pausing and adding more washing.The only problem is it tends to make loud banging noise if the machine is full, especially while washing heavy towels and Bed sheets, have to pick the right washing mode for every clothing, apart from that it is a great machine."
102,"Love this new lg no agitator great for clothes no tangle twisting, nice deep drum, a little to deep for me being short lolgreat finish, lots of washing choices.See through lid, soft close lid, Tells you when you need to do a clean basin wash.Easy to use touchpad."
103,"the clothes get cleaned ok but unless you increase the water level, they come out all crushed.  It is simple to use and sometimes the clothes still have marks on them, but that could be my detergent.  Today it is very hard to find a washing machine that rates as good as the old ones and lasts as long."
104,"Good washing Machine, I feel like my clothes are coming out much cleaner then with my previous model. Machine is quiet, easy to use. I really like that it has a quick wash option that still actually washes my clothes well. Also the 9.5kg is a great size for a family."
105,"The machine is worthless, a lot of LINT issues.  Also Support is terrible, they give you the run around and avoid any form of refund. Spent ages trying to trouble shoot, where the problem is the LG brand itself. The product has false advertising about auto lint removal! LG should be fine for false advertising and support goes to the Philippines where they don't care or respect their customer."
106,"The more they complicate the process, the easier it is to stuff up the works. The machine is simple enough to use, but it doesn't do a great job and for the brand and money paid, I expect it to be better.I have no idea why the machine has to dance a little jig before each and every wash, what the hell is that about? hy can't the machine just fill with water and start like they used to? The drum goes through this dance motion as if it has to limber up before a big match.I don't feel that it washes the clothes properly, and clothes regularly come out all knotted together. If that's what happens then how can clothes possibly be washed adequately?The timing is also completely off. Once you set it, the time can be 1 hour and 6 or 7 minutes etc, however several of those minutes are used while the machine fills. Another couple of minutes are used while the machine does this weird spinning action, (god knows what that's for), you then may be left with about 55 minutes of washing time which is so inaccurate it's laughable. Several times I've watched this machine allegedly washing clothes while the drum is hardly even moving. How can clothes be possibly washed in this manner. Then the timer may tell you that there's 35 minutes left, however come back and check on it 40 minutes later and it's still going. I watched this machine tell me that there is one minute left of its final spin and stood there for 3 minutes waiting for it to end. How long does 1 minute last in the LG world?Maybe I need to locate an old dial and set machine that clicks along when it goes through its various stages as I feel they washed clothes better and you had more control over how it operated. This thing is useless."
107,"Wish I had checked the reviews before purchasing this machine. Worst purchase we have ever made. 2 major issues1. Clothes come out with white residue/lint no matter what we do. We have tried all options as advised by customer service ie: changing type of powder used, manually selecting water levels and running numerous rinse cycles. Have run numerous tub clean cycles but the problem persists2. LG customer service is non existent. After numerous calls and wasting time being placed on hold the best that LG could do was to ask us to send a photo of the clothes after a wash showing the residue/lint that is left behind and email that to them"
108,Cleans really well clothes feel a lot cleaner then my old one it is very quiet I love the lil music chime at the end of every wash and my favourite feature is the soft close lid haven’t had a problem with it yet it’s the best washing machine we have had in a long time
109,The washing machine is huge it fits in a lot of clothes and washes them excellently every time. It is a tad noisy when on spin mode but it’s better then my old washing machine. It’s has many different modes to use. I have never used it on hot so don’t know how it goes with shrinking clothes.
110,This is my first top loader washer and I'm impressed. We have the 9.5kg and it is large enough to wash blankets which is a bonus. It has a quick cycle for washes under 3.5kg. My only issue with this washer is it leaves lint.on your clothes as it doesn't have a long filter to empty. It is a quiet machine and even has a quiet cycle.
111,"Great machine.quiet, efficient, good clean wash, had it for quite a few months now.no problems. One  thing not covered in manual -- the sign CL which means child lock.to open the lid again when lid locks you have to put finger on the rince button and hold it there for 3 seconds. Marvelous to know it locks if kids fiddle with buttons. Luv this machine."
112,"It cleans the clothes very well.A bit noisy . Reducing noise would greatly improve rating. My favourite feature are the different setting jt provides.Overall good quality and would recommend it to other people to buy. But keeps getting an error 1E, i dont know what it is ."
113,"Another item of necessary household equipment that my son needed when he moved out of home.  He appears to be very happy with the overall performance except he told me it doesn't load the clothes nor hang them out to dry...  This is something all sons realise when they leave home.....  His clothes appear to be cleaned well - not always ironed correctly, but that's another issue.  Overall, very happy."
114,This new LG Top Loader (2017) replaces a similar LG Top Loader purchased 1999 and which had given excellent service over that time.The washing cycles are now more complicated and we have hung the Manual next to the machine so that we can learn how to get the best from each cycle.
115,"A FEW GOOD TICKS:*Tick for the automatic lint filter which does not need emptying, we are getting a cleaner (almost) lint free wash.*Tick for the Towel cycle, this is becoming our favourite all-purpose cycle as it spins the water through the clothes to saturate and distribute the load – this cycle is doing a good job on all fabric types - but we do have to manually increase the water level.*Tick for the manual Ultra Spin function, being able to spin to damp-dry is very efficient.  Haven't tried the Air Dry yet, should be helpful in rainy weather.*Tick for no central impeller, able to easily fit pillows and duvets (but not necessarily at the same time!) in the generous bowl*Tick for how quiet it is across all cycles*Tick for how fresh the clothes smell - same water, same laundry detergent, but a distinctly fresher smell!"
116,"NOT CONVINCED AS YET:*Umm (jury is still out) for the fuzzy logic – as with the old machine Fuzzy Logic cycle, all the water levels are too low and have to be manually increased.*Umm for the complicated wash cycles – but Tick that we can create our own Favourite cycle and use that."
117,"OVERALL:We are very pleased with and happy to recommend, our new LG washing machine"
118,"Upgraded to this washing machine after the first one was faulty and had been discontinued. I find this machine quiet and with its large 9.5kg drum size, we are able to wash large loads of washing at a time. The biggest downside is sometimes it doesn't seem to clean the clothes adequately and tangles them."
119,"Great machine that can do so much. I do shift work and sleep all hours, so this machine fits my lifestyle well. The washing builds up over the week until I have time. I can fit a weeks worth of uniforms, clothes and queen bed sheets with no problems. I find it washes & rinses well, it is quiet and doesn't take long for the clothes to dry on the line. I like the duvet cycle for when you do the mattress and overlay covers, along with the doonas.  Ease to use, sort, add detergent and press start."
120,"It clean the close only if I wash with warm or hot water ‘it is a very quiet machine overhaul it rinse and spin dry just fine ,it’s very compact fits in a small place perfect for a unit ,looks good and I also like the glass within the lid"
121,"Our old washing machine died and we replaced it with this. Didn't realise how bad our old one was! This cleans our clothes so well, no marks are ever left over. The machine is super quiet despite spinning very fast, great range of functions to choose from as well. Love it!"
122,"We were taken in by the fact that the agitator is on the bottom of the barrel and thought clothes wouldn't get twisted around a central agitator , however , we were wrong and sometimes we can just lift the entire load out in one movement as every item is so intertwined . we also have a lot of trouble with lint on bigger items like sheets .  I'm of medium height and it's an effort  to reach the bottom of the barrel to retrieve  items . All in all we're not happy with our LG washer ."
123,"It washes SOOOO Clean and there is absolutely NO residue left after the rinse cycle.I love the fact that I can set it for extra Rinse Cycles if I wish.I have used the Delicate cycle for our Woolens, they have come up so soft and clean they will store ready for winter beautifully."
124,"Cleans well & spins out very well if set to Ultra. There are many different settings/combinations & it is worth while experimenting a little with these to discover the best wash for different items .It does not appear to be too hard on the clothes & is reasonable quiet. Takes big, thick quilts & washes them well. No agitator means items are easy to place into & remove from the drum.No filter I believe results in occasionally some fine fluff being left where clothing has been folded during final spin.If it cannot spin due to the washing being unbalanced it will frequently reload with water in order to attempt to re-balance or rearrange load instead of stopping with a warning beep . For some people this may be a good thing however if you are water conscious or on tank water this is a problem.Overall have been happy so far with the machine."
125,"Rinses perfect, keeps clothes in good condition, Would not even know its on... my fave features are the was cycle...After having a front loader then going to this top loader i would never ever buy a front loader again not to mention buying another brand. LG is definetly the machine to purchase.."
126,"This is a good machine, I am happy with our purchase, does big loads without any problems. Never gone off balance. Has a tub clean feature which is excellent, easy to access and clean filters (which was a feature I needed after a terrible previous machine's filter broke and was unable to be emptied). The tub dry is great, i put heavy loads to slin for an hour and it saves line dry time and saves things ending up in the drier as much. The delay start is awesome, i love being able to set the wash and hang it out first up in the morning. My only negatives is that i wish i could soak longer than an hour and also i have to wait for the end of the spin cycle to use the tub dry feature, you can't just make it spin for an hour at the end of the rinse, its a separate manual thing you have to do. Would recommend."
127,Wasn’t happy at first just not used to no middle washing device as this doesn’t have that but now that I’ve worked out all the different washing cycles I love itDoes get quite dirty around the rim of the tub and needs regular cleaning but I don’t mind as I always keep my stuff cleanIt is gentle on the clothes providing your using the right cycleHas smart phone technology for logistic issues which is handy if any problems do ariseIt big too bad in the noise level.
128,"This is a great washing machine , washes clothes really good But it doesn't have a lint filter and leaves lint all over the clothes once washed .. I have reduced this by raising the water levels so far so good only other thing is I'm quite tall and yet I still can't quite reach the bottom of the tub maybe some will require a small step.."
129,"The glass soft close lid is perfect for viewing. I always use cold water wash and the clothes come out beautifully clean. I've used the cotton cycle on most of the loads and it's excellent for just about everything. It's on legs so cleaning underneath is a breeze. It's really quiet so I use it at night to save energy. It's gentle on clothes, as there's no centre agitator. Although the machine decides the length of the wash, rinse and spin cycles, if you're washing bulky items (like towels or a doona) it's best to manually set the water level to the highest level to avoid the machine getting off balance. This machine is on loan to me from The Good Guys, but if I wanted a compact, efficient little machine then this would be it, she's terrific."
130,"Cleans and rinses clothes well, nice quiet machine good size. Fits plenty of items inside plus plenty of wash options. The only thing I don't like is that there is no lint filter but clothes do not come out covered in lint. Would definitely purchase this washing machine again. Happy customer."
131,"Washes well. However, am devastated the gentle cycle, which I used on my previous machine constantly, only washes with cold water.  Would not have bought this machine if I had known.   Back to hand washing my woollens  --   I never use cold water for delicates.   The machine  is quiet, and simple to use."
132,"This is a great machine,However I am quite short at 5' 2"" tall and have to use tongs to get the washing out of the bottom of the machine.It is easy to wash doonas and blankets because it doesn't have an agitator.It washes very well.I did have a problem with the lid when it was 5 months old.However LG were very quick and courteous with their response and replaced the lid promptly and without question.Thanks LG for great after sale service."
133,This Washing Machine has been great!
134,-Have done hundreds of loads of washing and always great results.
135,-Very Efficient-Good Size Loads-Enough options for washing a variety of ways-Good water and power rating-Low maintenance-audible complete tone
136,"Great little machine and good price and it has never messed up a load i.e powder distribution, softner, etc"
137,"Cleans items quite well.Tangles and twists items significantly more than the old LG front loader, but that goes with a top loader choice.Was quiet initially and then the solenoid for pump diversion became very noisy, has since quietened down somewhat.Very easy to configure for a large range of loads.Favourites seems to be the main usage for a 58 minute total using warm wash with extra rinsing and 60% water levels."
138,It won't clean your clothes you have to wash everything 4/5 times worst waste of money ever only bought it 3 weeks ago and already looking for a new one as it's driving me crazy don't waste your money buy something else that will wash spin and clean your clothes
139,"I swapped from a front loader to this LG machine and I love it. No more bending over and it is comparable in both power and water usage to my old machine. My washing comes out beautifully clean, even my husbands oily work clothes are spotless after washing. I love this machine and wish I had bought one earlier."
140,This washing machine is great for our family of 4. It fits a huge load and cleans very well. I use my machine regularly with 2 small children in cloth nappies so having a quiet machine is great. The only down side is it does tend to leave lint on the clothes but I have found this can be fixed by upping the water level manually. It's very easy to use and good value for money.
141,"Our clothes come out nice and clean. And in great condition. Noise wise not to bad, a lot  quieter than my last washer. Really nice with the delicate cycle, has never destroyed any clothes. Little jingle at the end of a wash is slightly annoying, but that's the worst thing about it."
142,We had a SIMSONS washing machine before which was very nosy and vibrating very badly. Thanks for this lg product ! It's so much nicer with a lot of features. There's a whites option too for the white clothes and as well for the winter clothes. A T B .
143,My washing just feels really clean and fresh with minimum wrinkling. The machine makes minimum noise. Various programs including a quick wash which is still very thorough. For those rainy days it has an air dry program for up to 90 minutes just getting as much water out as possible.
144,It's excellent so far working very well and the size is something else can do blankets and Doonas without any problems..rinses the laundry detergent very well no more powder on your clothes... very powerful and strong love the glass where you can see what's going on...if things gets tangled it's easy to fix..
145,So happy we finally made the decision to purchase a bigger machine.  After researching and watching the prices for ages we went for it!  We got a washer and dryer.  It's awesome having the bigger machine and the clothes feel so much cleaner.  Best decision we made in buying the machines.
146,"Washes and cleans clothes very well, it is very quiet, rinses out washing well which cuts down drying time, I like the jingle at the end of cycle.Plenty of settings to chose from depending on your washing needs. The main problem i have with this machine is the fact that it LEAVES LINT all over the washing which is annoying and time consuming plucking it off my clothes. I wouldn't bye this machine again."
147,"It is very cool, quiet , no agitator washes well.  I like how it uses very little water and it is also programmable so you can just press a button and go on your way. Our clothes are spun to near dry which cuts down the drying timeHighly recommend!"
148,"It is very cool, quiet , no agitator washes well and plays a song at the end of the load! I like how it uses very little water and it is also programmable so you can just press a button and go on your way till you hear the music!"
149,"This machine leaves lint all over your clothes, checked the instructions, no lint-filter to be cleaned or any other user issue. I've owned 4 washing machines previously, all cheaper than this one and none of them had a lint problem."
150,"The machine has a smart start system which is nice but generally defaults to 1.25 hour cycles, a little long for my liking."
151,Would not recommend this product.
152,"I recently upgrade my washing machine as my old LG stopped working after 15 years of use. Went with LG again. This new machine is OK it washes quite well but it has no lint catcher the lint goes through the machine and out a release pump which is hard to access, have already needed an under warranty service which LG supplied and was done quite quick which was a plus."
153,"Programs are way to long.Leaves lint all over your cloths.The sensor system is a pain as it overrides everything you want it to do.Never washes the same twice.Doesn't use enough water and some clothes never  even get wet, let alone washed.Brokedown after 7 months and had to have several parts replaced.Would never buy another machine  of this type.Very poor customer service from LG,but great service and help from the Good Guys,who sorted out many of the issues I was having.Would recommend the Good Guys Kawana"
154,"Great machine, cleans dirty clothes very well and rinses thoroughly. Quiet and efficient with easy to use control and start buttons. I like the glass top and the ability to throw clothes in after starting the wash. I like the beeping at the end to advise me the washing is finished."
155,"We have had this machine for over 3 months and use it about 4 times a weekThis is a great washing machine that does a very good tangle free job. Our clothes are spun to near dry which cuts down the drying time, very helpful in winter.The washer is simple to use and has a number of options for different materials and levels of grubiness etc.The only negative thing I can say is that the buttons are on the front of the machine and can be accidentally pushed when leaning in getting clothes out."
156,Top load machine is usually the choice if you have elder living with you. They don't have to bend to grab the clothes. The machine is quiet to my surprise and looks decent as well. It is also a little bit bigger than I expected but given its washing capability it is ok. Compared with a front load one I'd still recommend a front load one if you are willing to pay $200 more
157,This is the best ever machine I have purchased. It is quiet and you can fit a good load in since it does not have a centre peace spinner that takes up all the room and being direct drive it will last a lot longer. For the price it is far the best on the market
158,"This machine is awesome, not only is it well priced but the quality is great. The machine does a very thorough wash and i like that the settings are easy to navigate but at the same time offer a variety of wash cycles and even does a delayed button which is super cool"
159,We purchased this product as our old Hoover washing machine finally broke after almost 15 years.  We purchased the 6.5kg version to accommodate for when we have a big load of bed sheets etc which works well as it doesn't have a central agitator and more room for them to wash and not get tangled on it.  It plays a little song when the clothes are finished which is handy so you know when its ready to get them and not just switching between wash cycles.  The main preset buttons we use are 'normal' 'delicates' and 'duvets' and all seem to wash really well. This washer is perfect for a small family. Hope this review helps.
160,"I am using LG for last couple of months. Used almost 2-3 times in a week, some time more. It Cleans every cloths very well but you have to choose the right program mood. There more that 20 programs mode as well as plenty setting. But you don't need to be worried to set every piece of it. It has a nice AI. I never found any cloths to wear-out.  It runs very quietly, Quick wash is a cool program for me."
161,only had the machine for 2 months
162,"Love the delay feature. When you forget to do washing til bed time, you can just preset it and come home from work the next with the run just finished and ready to go on the line. no more sitting in the machine for 18h and needing to be rinsed again."
163,"We find the clothes come out pretty dry. Havent used the airdry feature yet as it is for 2kg max, which seems oddly small for an 8.5kg machine. would take 4 batches to do a complete load"
164,You do have to empty the lint filter basically every 2 runs or you will end up with lint on your clothes.
165,"Nice and quiet, and love that you can opt to use less water if you want."
166,What a load of lint that's what this machine is. I am so upset that my daughter and I bought the same machine and she has the same problem. I want to wash my clothes not sit there for half the day trying to remove lint from all the clothes and then if you use the Cotton Wash cycle which is normal cycle use it if you want all your clothes to look like they'd been sitting in a really hot sun all day all dried out terrible and upsetting it's a load of crap don't buy one you'll be sorry. I had an lg before this one and it was great so I decided when it went down it was time for new one NEVER AGAIN.
167,"We have had this machine for 3 months and is performing very well. Our clothes are cleaned and treated gently in the new agitation action. Fully automated just set and forget, it is so quiet and effective we can go off and do other tasks. With our normal washes being smaller loads the ""quick wash"" setting only takes 38 minutes however with larger washes you can set for larger water and longer spin cycles. We use the quick cycle and for jeans and heavier items we add additional spin pressure to get that extra water out so they dry quicker. We only like top loaders as our family have front loaders and find them less effective and less efficient when we use them. Our policy is to have an environmentally efficient house so this machine with controlled water level and short cycles automatically determined by weight of the wash is a great advantage and fits our requirements."
168,We had an old LG front load washing machine. we have been using that for more than 10yrs and we were happy with it that's why when it broke down and became irepairable I said that we will get the same one but my wife said that it is bettet to get a top load because she's now having problem whenever she bends to get the laundry from the machine. So we have this same brand LG but TOP LOAD ( smart drum with direct drive technology) for 10 months now. we wash our clothes almost everyday and washing clothes through this machine is somewhat enjoyable because it was easy and watet efficient (though i don't pay water rates coz im renting a unit) but still nice to know that i used less water. Normal washing would take about 35 to 60 mins depending on how dry do you want the clothes after the cycle( the spinning) which for me is just fine specially after seeing that my clothes are really cleaned after washing. The machine perform better when it is full than with only 2 or 3 items ( it tends to rattle due to imbalance) having said that im very satisfief with this machine and i can recommend it.
169,When I first used this 8.5 kg machine i repeatedly checked it to see if it was working as it was just so quiet. The clothes don't tangle as in my last machine. It also automatically fills the water to the right level for the clothes and so saves on water. I was apprehensive when buying this machine as it doesn't have a large agitator in the centre of the machine but the wash is A grade and it is so simple to clean the 2 small filters. I am so happy with the performance of this machine and although it has several settings I just set it to Fuzzy and it does the job well. I would highly recommend this machine and I purchased it on sale for $813 which included 6 year extended warranty and removal of old machine and packaging by the friendly professional J.B.HI FI Team at Kotara
170,I have owned this washing machine for about 10 months and it's been great.  No issues at all.  I used to have a front loader (Samsung) and this one (top loader) washes better - clothes are noticeably cleaner in less amount of time. Quiet too - can hardly hear it when doing the rinse.  Can highly recommend to anyone looking for a new washer.
171,I bought this one just a year ago..it has lots of new settings which my old one didn't had.. one i like most was auto settings.. it was clothes perfectly even if its soiled..  i found it can take better load then front loader machines. Doesn't make much noise.. just perfect!!!
172,"with a 9.5 kg load one can make laundry day a easy day to do.purchased from good guys for less than $800, with 3 year warranty,excellent buyvery quite to operate, high  star rating,i found that with the build up of  washing to do i needed an extra machine"
173,"The open design of the wash-tub (it has no central agitator/ pole) seems to make it easier for items to twist together, or at least that's what I think.  It seems to help to wash big things together or small things together and to not mix sizes of items up too much.  However, the wash quality is pretty good and it is easy enough to use - press for 'on' and then press the start button.  If you want, you can select the type of wash after turning on and then press start.  The machine adapts to the size of wash loaded and has a big capacity.  I was not happy to discover that it has no filter (poor research) and so needs a full run when empty to flush out the lint after each 30 or so washes.  That's a lot of wasted water in my opinion.  I tend to agree with other reviews posted here but it's not a bad machine overall."
174,Great machine. Paid $578 on sale and it is a bargain. Don't think my clothes have ever been so clean. It is quiet and has a huge amount functionality. I prefer to just set and forget with the 'Fuzzy' function which weighs the load and then goes about its wash cycle - but the amount of cycle options is endless.
175,"Unfortunately our front loader washing machine has broke down in Feb this year and we had to get a new one. This time we have decided to try the top loader as I often find myself forgetting an item or 2 after turning the washing machine on, and you cant open the door on the front loader to add extra laundry in once its started.summary of the above washing machine:Plus point:1) big size, 9.5kg allows us to wash quilt, blankets and pillows with ease2) see through glass on the top to see whats happening3) option to stop the machine to add items that you forgot to added in during washing4) advanced computerised operating options to customise how you want the washing down, including the number of rinse cycle, level of water, minutes of washing...etc which I thought was fabulous5) the extra spin cycle gets clothes really dry, so less time needed to get the clothes to dry completely under the sun or in the dryer"
176,"Negative point, not many;1) Large size, takes up rooms in your laundry space2) being a large machine, if you only have a small load of washing, despite being able to adjust the water level, you are still ended up using quite a lot of water, as you need the water level to be high enough to cover the clothes3) the cycle takes a long time which costs more electricity"
177,"This is a new machine for us, over all we are happy with the product so far, we will wait and see how it performs for a longer term."
178,"It Cleans clothes excellent and no stitching coming apart like in other washing machines,Plus I think its reasonably quiet, Best of all, Wait for it............................. NO LINT to clean, It does it for you, the only thing you need to do is, when it asks you to do a tub clean, It's quite simple really, Just press tub clean, It does require 3 hours so make sure you have washed everything prior to doing this next step, Goodluck"
179,"It is a well balanced machine, it is very quiet and washes clothes very gently. I love that it does not have the agitator int he middle and also has many programmed settings suitable for all washing types and cycles. Can fit a great load of washing at one time, highly recommended for a 4-5 person family."
180,my home 7people use this machine very good choice everyday can use. Big size can wash my bedding. everyday use quickly and clean . easy useing my daughter can do and when finish got music call u go to next job. very good washing machine better than other brand. yes
181,"Ok, bear with me here, the machine works well, washes clothes relatively well and does what you would expect it to do. I will say that the “quick wash” could be drier, as the clothes come out rather wet. It does have an air drier feature that does a good job, however it has to be set post the cycle finishing, which for me is rather pointless. Either way I wish I had of brought a front loaded…."
182,"Quiet, washes and rinses.   Bad design in some ways.  Drum is far too deep - difficult to reach small items at the bottom unless you are tall with long arms.  Very easy to accidentally undo settings during a pause because the controls are super sensitive and at the front of the machine making them easy to knock accidentally. LG should put the controls at the back.  Quick wash cycle is only allowed for small loads needing low water level.  Sometimes you need a quick wash for one or two larger items needing higher water level eg quilt covers."
183,"It says 'filter free' on the machine.  The sales pitch is that you don't need to clean the filter.  The reality is that your next load of washing is the filter for the previous load!!  For instance, on the weekend I washed towels (orange colour - this is important).  A couple of days later I washed some work clothes - black pants, shirts etc.  The pants were covered in orange lint... and there was nothing remotely orange in the load with the pants.  Called LG - response - you need to run the tub clean... Ah ha, every time I finish washing towels, I should follow this up with a 3 hour tub clean cycle.  That makes sense!!  Washed a heavy cotton (cream) bathrobe on its own and it was covered in dark lint.  I think the machine stores the lint, then detects what colour clothing you are washing and spits out the exact opposite colour of lint just to create as big a mess as possible."
184,"It also has 'ultra' spin speed - but this leaves heavy items, e.g. towels, bathmats, quite wet and hard to dry in winter - certainly too wet for tumble drying."
185,"Also, very, very slow and clunky...  a full 'cotton wash' can take over 90 minutes.  I know that that's how long a front loader would take, but at least a front loader would do a good job of the washing."
186,Getting rid of this stupid machine - Asko here I come!
187,"Had the Fisher and Paykel top loader for over 10 years. Did very well. For the price, this machine does all it is asked, quite and washes well. Not sure why people are complaining about lint - no problem here. Seems to be a bit more economical as well and does not crunch up the clothes."
188,It is very gentle on my clothes they never come out tangled. The design is very stylish. Has really good washing functions and very easy to use. It is designed to be easy to clean. It washes much better than any other washing machine I have ever owned overall extremely happy with this machine and I cannot fault it
189,Bought  and delivered saturday from harvey norman  4th Feb 2017.delighted with this machine.it is now 5th June.  Never had a problem .washes very well.perfect for me because I am tall and it takes a big wash.short people may have a problem reaching into bottom of tub .my last machine hitachi did wash in half hr. This one takes about an hr.but apart from that I think it's an excellent machine.
190,November 5th 2017 Update: Great washing machine bought in Feb 2017 no problems quiet efficient cleans and RInses well
191,This washing machine takes a big load because it is tall. Not suitable for short people.Had it for 9 months now. Am very pleased with it.does a good job. MAKE SURE YOU GET INSTRUCTIONS with it other wise you might feel it's confusing in certain areas of use.I love it so far. No problems at all.
192,"There is no lint filter and when washing large items e.g.sheets, they come out covered in brown sediment. White sheets have brown streaks all over them and black sheets are covered in white streaks. Wash cycle is far too long and the depth if the drum is so deep you almost end up on your head retrieving small items."
193,Washes clothes well and seems to rinse them well. Without the agitator it is also gentle on your washing. It's much quieter than our old Simpson washer. I like the fact it has 1 touch operation and will work out water requirements and wash cycle itself. Being a busy home with daily washing we hope that it lasts longer than the three year the last one lasted.
194,"There is no filter so clothing is covered in lint, and the clothes wash unevenly.  Nothing works - less detergent, more detergent;  less water, more water etc. etc."
195,For 30+ years we had Simpson machines and they were faultless.  We were persuaded to LG by the staff at Harvey Norman (good marketing!).  This is an expensive machine which doesn't do the job.
196,"Leaves lint on black, white & coloured clothes.  Does not spin towels properly. Patchy areas of garments that have not got wet during cycle.  Oily marks appear after a wash & does not remove easy stains.  Had to bucket water into machine & LG customer service does not exist.  Never again!"
197,"We upgraded to this machine after using an old Fisher and Paykel for many, many years. What a disappointment to learn that our brand new washing machine leaves clothes dirtier than the old one! The problem is, like so many other commenters have suggested, LINT. After a few washes, it accumulates in the machine and covers EVERYTHING. We've had to stock up on lint brushes and rollers just to keep our clothes clean. Black clothes come out looking white!"
198,"The particular model we have, the WTG8532WH (8.5kg), does not have a lint filter. There is nothing in the instructions manual about cleaning build ups of lint - the cleaning cycle only removes scrud, and actually instructs to remove the lint from the machine before performing the cycle (how??). We've tried hot washes, liquid detergent, higher water levels to no avail. I regret buying this machine and would advise anyone against it."
199,PROS:- Clear lid so you can see wash- Sooooort of programmable but seems to have a mind of its own and snaps back to its own programs if you play around too much with the settings- No tower thing in the middle so clothes don't get caught on it- Does seem to wash away dirt and other stains
200,"CONS:- LINT. SO MUCH LINT.- Very heavy duty and has ripped some delicate clothes to shreds. Delicate cycle not much better.- Long cycles. Cannot perform a quick wash if clothing weight is over a certain amount- Like I said above, difficult to program custom cycles- Performs a little tune when wash is done (really). Probably a small thing but it irks me no end."
