"1" "Just set it up yesterday and so far so good. I am coming from a Samsung and just didn¡¯t want to spend a lot. Like other reviewers said, the legs aren¡¯t the best. I wouldn¡¯t want them for a larger heavier model. I do intend to mount it on the wall in the future but I think it would do fine on the legs. I like the settings menu, it jumps out from the side. You have several presets and can adjust all the usual settings: brightness etc. the sound is great, 10 is too loud. Pretty light as expected. The picture looks great, better than my Samsung, even on old Sanford and Son from the 70s! Connecting to Netflix and amazon is easy and QUICK and there are buttons for both. I don¡¯t use cable btw. Connecting to internet is easy. The menu jumps up from the bottom with all those apps and info as well. I¡¯m pretty impressed with the interface of this tv and I think LG has won me over from Samsung. My Samsung struggled with staying connected to Internet and Netflix etc was always freezing and dropping so I would have to turn it off and back on. I don¡¯t care for the remote it is small and seems cheap. Samsung makes a large remote that¡¯s easy to use and sturdy enough to smack someone with. I have big hands and this remote makes me feel like adre the giant. Bottom line I¡¯m very happy with the tv, I¡¯d buy it again and I¡¯m thinking about getting one for my parents. Good interface, good picture, good price, couldn¡¯t ask for better except the legs. Samsung who??

"2" "This is a great TV for the money. It has a great piture and lots of features. Keep in mind this is not an OLED TV so it doesn¡¯t have the best contrast or super deep blacks like all LED/LCD screens. If you set up the picture settings correctly you will have a great picture. There are lots of videos and articles that explain how to do this online. You also have to be using the correct cables. You can¡¯t use regular old HDMI cables. You have to use cables that support the latest and greatest features. You also have to be aware that only 4K content is going to look super amazing. Watching OTA TV, cable, satelitte, DVD, regular Blu-rays, and 99% of all online videos will not be in 4K and su the picture has to be streched yo fill your TV screen. This is called upsampling.  You have to set yor picture ssettings for each input. Also setting up the picture settings for 1 app (Netflix for example) sets the same settings for all apps. And if your gaming use Game mode in the picture settings. Game mode has very low input lag.The sound is decent but don¡¯t expect much from tiny speakers in flat screen TV¡¯s. I got a sound bar to get the best sound possible.  The TV is easy to set up. Has lots of great features and apps. I was surprised to see Youtube TV which I like. You can share your phone and computer screen but. Not all computers will share though. I have three PC¡¯s and coulld not connect to the TV by adding the TV as a device on the PC settings. But I was able to connect my newest PC to the TV by adding the TV as a wireless screen on the PC. The downside to this method is the sound comnes out of the PC and not the TV.  Sharing your phone is easy but you will need to download a Miracast app form the app store on your phone. I was able to stream a movie from my Android phone this way using VLC player. The TV also sees my router and NAS drive as media servers and was able to watch a movie on the TV from the NAS drive. I can also view pictures and play my extensive music collection as well.  I also setup Google Assistant on the TV as well. Alexa is also supported. Another great feature is casting Youtube videos from the phone to the built in Youtube app on the TV. This way you can easily pick what video you want to watch on your phone then send it to the TV. This is great for me as I have poor vision and can¡¯t read the text on the TV screen unless I am very close. Oh and for watching movies from the NAS... I have files in the AVI, MP4 and MKV formats. They are all playable on the TV. And for music the TV can play 320kbs MP3's from the NAS. Not sure about other formats.Lastly. I recommend getting the LG Magic remote.  It¡¯s not a great universal remote but you can use the remote as a pointer on screen which makes navigating web sites (yes the TV has a web browser) very easy. It also has a voice function which allows you to open apps and inputs and more easily. You also use the remote to use Google Assistant or Alexa. Be sure to turn off Audio Guidance in Settings/Accessibility for the TV as neither the pointer nor the voice function will work with it on.I highly recommend this TV.

"3" "I purchased this TV as well as an LG soundbar and 4K Blu-ray player to replace a six year old LG plasma 60\" TV that is dying. The TV looks good and was easy to set up including connection to the soundbar. I liked the features, ease of use, picture and user interface and app improvements compared to my old LG. The mounts for tabletop use work, but they are quite minimal. Sadly, this TV started having problems on the second day starting with purple vertical bars on the screen that progressed to multiple color bars ending in no picture or sound. I was on the phone for hours with LG trying to resolve it. Resets and power cycles did not resolve it (not surprisingly). LG's support service is lacking with their referral to non-participating service providers and unreachable providers.  After much insistence, my case was apparently escalated, and the issue was to be transferred to LG field support. I was adamantly assured I would be contacted soon on that day. I wasn't. This \"support\" is unacceptable for this product. The support representatives were friendly though, although the inference that this internal hardware issue might be physical damage as not appreciated (presumably as a way to escape support responsibility). It might otherwise be a good product, but with LG's failure to resolve the issue, I returned the TV and Amazon was good in that process. I do not recommend LG now, particularly if you have to get LG support or service.UPDATE: I received a second TV from Amazon, and so far (four days), it is performing well.  As with the other one, setup was easy. It works well with LG's SK6Y soundbar and SPK8-S rear speakers. Playing a regular Blu-ray disk on the connected LG UP875 produces an exceptional upscaled picture. My original review was one star due to the early failure and LG's pathetic response. I have added a star for the performance so far of this second TV. I am concerned that it might fail later and I have to try to deal with LG again.

"4" "Decided to leave Samsung and swing over to LG. Great decision. Great vivid picture with this set. Sound is typical with tv¡¯s being not so great but passable. Set up was easy. Great remote that includes  2 buttons, one for Amazon access and one for Netflix. I would recommend this tv for those looking for a good 55¡± tv with a great picture.
            "
"5" "The default setting for the energy saving setting is \"on\" which makes the picture very very dark.  In my opinion, the default setting should be \"off\", and let the owner decide to use it or not.  It took a long time for me to find out it was the energy saving feature being \"on\" which was causing my TV to be very dark when initially setup.
            "
"6" "Every time I turn it off it loses wifi connection.  When I turn the tv back on the wifi is disconnect and it can't see any wifi signals at all, and I live in an apartment complex.  I have to unplug the tv every time then plug it back in.  Its like the wifi card in it needs to be rebooted every time I turn the tv off which sucks for a smart tv.  Tried using a cable instead of wifi.  Same problem, losses signal anytime TV is turned off.  Have to unplug tv to get it to start having internet again.  Unplugging the TV fixes the problem, so I know the TV is the problem and not the internet.  Not a smart TV.

"7" "The first one they sent to me was broken, I was really bummed out...But after I got on the phone with Amazon customer service I was amazed.In a five minute phone call they already had the new TV ordered and on it's way.When I got the TV it was easy to set up right out of the box, phenomenal picture quality...It makes standard television shows burst right out of the screen with crisp vivid color and detail.For the price, this is a no-brainer buy, very pleased...
            "
"8" "1ST...Easy setup (physically) right out of the box.  Slide the stands in place, plug in all your cables and you're ready for step 22ND...The programming setup will walk you through the entire process, but it is time consuming.  You will need to tweak some of the factory setting to your preference, and, there are many of those to chose from.  For the best performance, try as many as you can.Summary:  There is no way to describe the picture of this UHD verses 1080i.  Even old western movies appear as new as ever.  The sound quality is superb !  I have it connected with my Bose system and it will blow you out of the room !  Great TV with great sound !

"10" "My last TV purchase was 11yrs ago when we moved into our new house. We just moved again, and even though our OLD TV was working just fine, we decided it was time for something that could handle 4k and offer other features we had read about but never had experienced. The picture on this TV is scary good, like all I could say was WOW and kept calling my wife and kids over to take a look.  I added the Wohome sound bar and now the audio matches the picture quality and for only $100 more!  What a great tv watching experience, like nothing we have seen before.  Thank you LG!  Its our very first LG TV and was recommended to me by my brother.  He sure gave me a great recommendation!
            "
"11" "<U+00A0>This TV is advertised as having a suite of features which you are can utilize via Alexa integration.  This is marketing hype and the product does not do what they advertise.  Only 1 Alexa function works - Turns off TV ... nothing else works as advertised.We just installed an LG Smart TV and LG Washer/Dryer. All purchased for the full smart home experience. We have so many other smart home features integrated with Alexa and working fine (GE light switches, Schlage Connect front door lock, Honeywell thermostat, U Moen shower system, window blinds and several other features). So, troubleshooting the occasional glitch in initial integration is par for the course.However, LG completely falls flat on its face. Their \"smart\" appliances are only that in name, not in fact. Despite cycling through repeated efforts of integration (deleting and reinstalling skill, deleting LG account and re-creating, etc) this TV and the LG app would never integrate with Alexa aside from the ability to turn off the TV. The rest of the time the \"TV is unresponsive\".Likewise, the washer and dryer fail to be identified and linked with the LG account.LG has a very long way to go to actually turn this into a working product. They should not be advertising these half-baked features and selling appliances under false advertisement. They have the deep pockets to develop these features correctly before release but they really have not.Do not buy LG if you are wanting the smart home integration experience. You will be severely disappointed.If I would have known of this terrible integration with Alexa I would not have purchased this TV.  That was a major deciding factor in why we bought it.

"12" "So surprised at the picture quality for the price! Viewing 4K content is dreamy! Set up was quick and tv walks you through it after plug-in and power on. Remote included is more than sufficient for me, and magic remote is sold separately but I don¡¯t really know if I want one. Preloaded apps update easily and quickly and include Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime video, with others available for download. Bluetooth function plays music or whatever from your smartphone, sound is good, but I¡¯ll be adding a sound bar at some point. Overall, I¡¯m very pleased! Legs are a little flimsy and require a philips head screwdriver FYI.
            "
"13" "Really good for the price. My 3rd LG TV. I moved away from Samsung to LG as LG is better quality. Picture quality is amazing. 3 HDMI (for DVD, PS4, PS3, Switch, etc), 1 component (for Wii), 2 USB and one optical audio port. Remote has button for Amazon Prime and Netflix. Some reviews mention that the legs are flimsy, which they are, but they do the job that they are intended to do. Can't beat the price.

"14" "Usage:Have an AppleTV (4K) and a Nintendo Switch plugged into it.  We watch DIRECTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime and various other content apps (HBO GO, etc.) regularly.  Owned it for almost a week now by the time this review was written\posted.  Doubt continued use will change the review but, you never know¡¦NOTE: TV has latest Firmware\Software installed of 3.00.80 per About TV info at time of reviewPros:Great pictureDecent Sound (as with most TVs of this type, if you don¡¯t like the sound, get a soundbar you do like; one was not connected or used for this review)Has 3 HDMI inputs (though one is on back of TV which can be problematic depending on how you mount the TV to a wall)Once the apps are updated, it¡¯s nice being able to launch Netflix or Amazon with a single click of a dedicated button on the remote if wanted (though we just use our AppleTV for all content anyways).Cons:Having to connect to the internet to update what should be the resident apps (like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Screen Sharing, etc.) before you can even use the apps for the first time.LG Content Store was not reachable thru our Wi-Fi network.  Had to tether TV to our cell phone to connect to LG Content Store in order to update the apps prior to first use.No clear way to remove apps you don¡¯t particularly need or want (especially if you don¡¯t use Netflix or Amazon) especially when you see the 500 or so MB of space start going down every time you ¡®update¡¯ an app for the first time you use it.HDMI port 1 now doesn¡¯t function after attempting to use TV temporarily as a monitor for laptop to share content.  Port shows no signs of damage, it just doesn¡¯t work anymore.Doesn¡¯t keep Wi-Fi network settings so if you jump from your 5G Wi-Fi to 2G Wi-Fi network connection or tether TV to Cell Phone, you have to re-enter the password every time you change.Unable to get Amazon Echo\Alexa devices to connect to TV.Wired Ethernet Port and one of the HDMI ports (Port #3) faces the wall side of the TV.  If you use a fixed mount or tilt mount, this may be an issue if you use these ports.  Unfortunately I¡¯m having to use one as my HDMI #1 port doesn¡¯t function anymore.Not necessarily a pro or a con:For those that mount your TV to a wall, you may need to buy a new mount especially if you¡¯re upsizing and have limited mounting spots.  The VESA is 300x300.  Our slightly smaller TV had VESA 200x200 and we had to switch from a full motion mount to a tilt only mount.  For our specific installation, the older tilt only mount we are using is rated for 100 or so pounds and a smaller TV (back when LED TVs were still thick and heavy).  If I had to buy a newer tilt only or fixed mount, I wouldn¡¯t be able to mount it due to the distance between my power outlet and HDMI outlet is only 24 inches and mounts for a TV of this size are 29 inches wide and mount would have to go over outlets in order to fit TV above fireplace and below ceiling; not workable.Definitely has the Soap Opera Effect until you turn off LG TruMotion.It would be nice to be able to change to and launch other content providers from the two quick buttons on the remote (i.e. if a DIRECTV NOW app was ever released or someone primarily watches Hulu)Review:If you¡¯re buying the TV to be just a TV, then it fits the bill.  If you want to use the Smart TV functions of it, you may experience some ¡®fun¡¯ trying to get stuff to work and if you¡¯re not tech savvy to know how to use workarounds (like tethering the device to your phone), you may get disappointed or irritated by stuff not working with no clear way to fix it.  I haven¡¯t tried to figure out how to fix connecting the TV to my Amazon Alexa\Echo device though it¡¯s supposedly certified to work with them though I have the Skill and everything seems to be installed properly (for what I see on the Internet, this problem is a ¡®feature¡¯).  As stated above the HDMI port #1 doesn¡¯t work anymore (again, I¡¯ve only owned this TV for 5 days).  I have not contacted LG or Amazon yet about this and will update my review if I decide to do so.  Another issue that resolved itself is that there was a snack plate sized ¡®ghost¡¯ like area on the screen.  I used a paper towel with some ¡®cleaner¡¯ to clean the whole screen and the spot went away (even though it didn¡¯t smear or change when I brushed my finger across it).  I¡¯m not entirely sure what it was but I have a couple similar spots in the lower right hand corner of my screen that only show when the screen area is black.  I assume there is a protective screen\window that bends\deforms slightly and picks up light being emitted by the TV and that when cleaning it, it bends it differently or nudges it into and\or away from the areas hit by the light.  A pure shot in the dark on that issue.  The couple 'light' spot do not bother us so it is what it is.  If the one spot towards the center-left of the screen didn't clear, that would have been a complete different thing as that would have bothered us.
            "
"15" "Reading these 1 star reviews and they make sense. There are multiple issues with this TV that needs to be addressed:WiFi / ethernet:This TV does lose internet literally every time the TV goes in \"Standby\" or is turned off. When trying to back to the WiFi after it randomly disconnect it keeps giving you an error stating, \"Unknown error occurred\". I reset the TV to fix this, no change. I would literally have to put my password in for my WiFi 10 times before it worked. Super irritating and time consuming. I decided to put in an ethernet cable into the TV to avoid this issue. I sometimes get the message stating there's no internet somehow... Then when my PCs are sharing media to this TV they lose connection for literally no reason at all. So then I have to turn the TV off and back on again to fix that. Then go through the whole steps of: Device connector, PC, Next, and then pick my device. That's time consuming and irritating as hell.Sleep / Standby:My TV I bought 5 years ago has more features than this TV and is a lot easier to use. Why doesn't this TV have a inactive timer on it that actually SHUTS off the TV and not put it on standby? That's annoying and assuming that uses most of my electric bill. Its annoying to have to set a sleep timer on the TV for something that should have been automatically put on for us.

"16" "Besides ,or instead of all the usual blah blah boring remarks on specs ,which is already shown about this TV,  I will tell you ( as a self proclaimed techie) that this TELEVISION in MY opinion,  cannot be matched !And I'm not just referring to it's super reasonable price point , it is by far the best set I've owned in the last 10 years.Okay , imagine setting it up , getting on Wi-Fi,  then the next morning you fire the TV up and to your surprise, and GLEE , you have 200 + plus new FREE channels thru LG XUMO !!I was so excited I thot it was some kinda advertising scam or I don't know .I have since 17 years of age ,always fascinated with anything concerning the ship TITANIC ,well lo and behold,  the XUMO channels have an actual TITANIC channel  !Needless to say I was / am just thrilled about these extra FREE channels, and trust me ,there are MANY interesting and educational channels along with tons of genre's to view.So, in closing, I totally recommend this TV and I believe you will be 1000%HAPPY!

"17" "Use caseI bought a low-end Samsung 52\" 1080p TV set in 2015 for my den.  The idea was that it was only going to be occasionally used, since the projector had been the primary display in that room up to that point.  Things change, though, so the TV ended up being the primary display in the room.  It had an IPS panel, but the backlighting was not great (uneven, with lots of light bleed), so I replaced it with a high-end LG LED-backlit LCD (opted to not get OLED).  That moved the Samsung to the master bedroom, and the oooold CCFL-backlit mid-grade Samsung was nixed in favor of the den Samsung.  The main problem is the lack of HDMI ports - with 2, it's one short of what I need (Fire TV, Ceton, and Bluray player).  I needed a TV that had good picture quality (IPS), was inexpensive, and either had 3xHDMI (or had some of the equivalent functionality built-in)Packaging/Build Quality/AppearanceAs with most TVs, this one arrived in a massive shipping box.  The outer box was relatively nondescript, while the inner box was the one with the bold 4-color graphics.  This can be a plus if you're concerned about package thieves.  The rest of the packaging consists of various Styrofoam blocks.  The stands are located in the top block, each in sheet foam.  The manual, power cord, cord organizer, remote, and batteries are all in a bag.  The TV has some protective plastic on the bezel and an EnergyStar sticker.  The build quality is fine, with no sharp or ugly injection seam lines.Appearance/SetupMake no mistake, this is the bottom of LGs Smart TV product lineup, and is definitely a no-frills affair.  The stand is CHEAP - it supports the weight of the TV (which is its job, I guess), but I would not trust it with even a little bit more weight (like someone putting their hand on it and pushing down a little).  Higher in LG's lineup, the stands would be made of aluminum... but those TVs also cost quite a bit more.  The stands are rotate into keyed holes in the bottom of the panel unit, and secure with two screws (each).  As for the rest of the TV, the bezel is a little chunky, and the unit is a little thick (more reminiscent of the CCFL LCD TVs), but it's handsome enough.  The ports are split between the side of the unit (2xHDMI + 1xUSB in), and the back (everything else).  This setup is fine for a media stand, but you'll need to think about what ports you are going to need if you want to wall mount the TV.  The power cable had a right-angle plug, which is nice regardless of how the TV is setup.The setup of the unit is very similar to all other WebOS LG TVs.  It first walks you though language and time zone settings, and even asks you about your TV tuning situation (cable box vs. terrestrial vs. other).  Next is the networking setup.  The TV has both a wifi adapter and wired Ethernet.  I would recommend using wired whenever possible, though the wifi seemed fine.  The TV got a DHCP address just fine, and you can configure the NetBIOS name for the TV on your network (for Miracast, DLNA, etc.).  Side note: as you configure the TV it makes you agree to some of the standard legal stuff, but it bundles in some settings for monitoring you viewing habits - by default, they're enabled... be sure to disable them.On the WebOS side, I updated the Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu clients.  They all appeared to look as good and work as well as the equivalents on a 4k Fire TV.  Some of the WebOS stuff here and there seems like it was meant for one of the point-to-select LG remotes, but there's only a standard remote present.  The remote has quick launch buttons for Amazon and Netflix.As far as picture quality, the TV has a 4k IPS panel, and supports HDR.  1080p and 4k material both looked better than the outgoing Samsung 1080p model, but the color accuracy was not great on the factory settings.  When I went to adjust the picture I found a shocking lack of adjustment options.  I ended up selecting \"GAME\" and fiddling with the rest of the settings to get to a picture that I though looked a bit more natural.  I selected the \"GAME\" mode because there didn't appear to be any other way to turn off the frame interpolation (weird).  Granted, you are not really going to have an ISF technician dial in this TV set, but it's just an odd choice to have removed so many of the picture tuning options.A couple wrap up items:1. Sound.  Generally speaking, I never use the speakers built in to my primary display, and instead send the audio via HDMI to my receiver.  However, in the bedroom, I prefer to keep it simple, and don't use a receiver.  I don't use soundbars because they generally only marginally improve the dreadful onboard audio problem with TVs.  This TV has above average speakers for the price class.  If you pick the right DSP mode, you will have clear sound (the wrong ones will just create a muddy sea of noise).  It will be devoid of useful bass and spatial positioning within the soundstage, but what do you expect out of tiny speakers that aren't forward-facing?2. Miracast.  It's not that the \"smart\" TV stuff isn't useful, but I think the inclusion of Miracast is an underappreciated feature.  Casting from a phone, laptop, or tablet help make up for any holes in the LG's app suite.3. DLNA. This is another one of those things that you either are into, or you have no idea what it is.  It's great to put your video and audio assets on a QNAP or Synology NAS, or any number of PC-based DLNA servers.  The DLNA client on this TV is pretty nice, and the supported codec set is pretty complete (requiring no transcoding in most instances).ConclusionWhile I'm sure LG can monetize the user viewership telemetry information, I really don't like how it's made to look like accepting more terms of service agreements.  Sure, people should read what they're agreeing to, but LG did try to make that setup section look exactly the same as other mandatory items.  As for the TV, it's pretty nice for the price.  Once adjusted, the picture is quite good.  You miss local dimming and some of the fine adjustment settings you'd get at a higher price point.  The smart functions provide streaming experiences that are comperable to a base Roku or 4k Fire Stick, but you are a little restricted with the remote.  I don't know that I'd buy this to be a primary TV, but I think it's great for something like a bedroom TV.  Recommended.

"18" "I am completely blown away by the picture and sound quality .. especially considering the price point. It did take a bit of tweaking to calibrate the screen to my liking (I also like the fact that you can have different picture settings, per HDMI input device), but I cannot be happier with the overall results. It upscales normal HD to UHD wonderfully.I saw some negative comments about the stand quality, but in all honesty .. I didn¡¯t use it. I needed a pedestal type stand and ordered that separately (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 23-49 inch LCD LED TVs - only $26.99). I¡¯m quite happy about that too.

"19" "I am quite disappointed with this TV. I bought it to replace an 47 inch LG 3D TV that was five years old and not a 4 K TV. The picture is quite dim compared to the older TV.  You really can not watch this TV in a sunny room. The TV is also quite wobbly, so much so that I was afraid it would be knocked over, so ended up nailing the legs using large staples to a wooden TV stand, otherwise I would be afraid that a child or pet could topple the TV. The previous old TV had a heavy metal base (stand) that prevented the TV from falling over. Don't buy this TV if you have small children or pets.

"20" "I expect a full refund. The feet failed.

"22" "This has bad reviews for dumb reasons. This is the BEST tv I've ever bought. Jeez! Clean picture, amazing sound, large number of options for picture, sleep mode. I havent even fully explored this tv yet even. the only problem people report is the chord and the screen breaking. the former I havent had problems, the second that's shipping and handling. dont blame lg. you do need to buy the magic remote control which doesnt come with this tv though.
            "
"23" "The TV will not turn off using the remote in one try.  Have to turn it off and wait 60 seconds to see if it comes back on.  Same with turning it on.  Remote doesn't work well but neither does any of the other remotes synced to operate this TV.  Therefore it is a TV problem.  Called LG numerous times and all they say is unplug it for 15 seconds.  After doing this the remote works once or twice and back to the original problem.  You would think LG could come with a better solution...ie take the TV back and send a new one.  This problem has plagued this TV since the first day we used it.

"24" "When my son set it up it worked great.  The next day it would not connect to the Internet.  My son reset all the settings to get it to connect.  Every day, for a week, I have had to reconnect it to the Internet to watch Prime or Netflix.  I called LG.  They sent a technician out that didn't know as much as I do.  He kept trying to connect to live TV, even though I told him 3 times I didn't have TV channels that all I had was Prime and Netflix.  He told me I had the wrong remote but the remote he tried to use got a message it wasn't compatible with the TV.  He called LG and then told me he would come back later that day after Direct TV came out to set my TVs up for it.  He never called and he never showed up.  I am so very disappointed as I heard LG was a good brand TV.
            "
"25" "The LG replaced one of the best TV's I ever had. I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I  replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know  what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK.  I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record.  It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and  DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV.  I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards.  This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details,  they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS  battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a  bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar.  I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth.  I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So  I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar.  So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed,  all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it.  One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one.  The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV.  You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big,  Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews.

"26" "I bought this TV based on good reviews even though there were other TVs with similar features for lower price. It's been only few weeks and I don't have any complaints about the basic and smart features. But the WiFi stopped working after a week or so. After trying several wierd suggestions to change settings found online, I guessed that 5G WiFi could be the problem. I split my AT&T Wifi into 2G and 5G networks with different names and finally the TV was able to connect to 2G network. It's a shame that their 5G implementation is not upto the mark even in 2018.
            "
"27" "The worst picture quality I have ever seen. The picture has a yellowish tint and all skin tones are washed out. None of the \"advanced\" adjustments would respond.
            "
"28" "The item was shipped in the TV box, that was also inside another large cardboard box, with plenty of protection from the shipping process. The outer cardboard box did have some holes poked in it but didn't really have any damage to the actual TV box.The stand came with two legs that needed to be popped in, twisted to lock, and screws to make it stable. Not too hard at all to get set up but might need two people to do it if you're not going to have the space to lay the TV on a flat surface on it's back... of course not plugged in while doing so.Sound is quite loud and has many different settings, but don't expect booming bass or anything.Set up wasn't too much of a hassle, nothing to sign up for really just sign into your streaming accounts and surely people know how to do that. The only hassle really is to set up each setting for each device. You will not want the same settings for streaming Netflix as you do playing PS4 Pro/XB1X/Switch/PC. Gaming should always be in Game Mode. That's the longest thing you'll be doing, getting used to the interface/settings/tweaking it all.I have posted some quick photos in my very dark room area and it's amazing. I don't even have the brightness up very high and it's still plenty bright. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it. It's the best budget 4K gaming TV for the brand/price on here. I bought mine for $516 with shipping included.
            "
"29" "A CR Best Buy, which is why I bought it.  Can't beat it for the price, and attaching accessories is really easy using the \"magic remote\".  The little legs make me nervous as they do not hold the TV as steady as I would like (it is on a console table), but on the other hand the gap between the legs has allowed my to put the soundbar directly under the TV.
            "
"30" "It¡¯s a wonderful android tv so far. I connected my devices, Nvidea Sheild, Fire TV, and Roku in the three hdmi ports. Also connected the digital antenna for live tv.
            "
"31" "First off, let me say that the TV looks good, its features as a smart TV are comparable to my samsung and it was very responsive to remote commands. The TV however falls short in its ability to remain in working condition in less than 30 days. Currently HDMI port 1 does not work at all. The TV will sense a device when you activate the device while the TV is on but will decide there is no signal. The work around to this was using HDMI port 2. Well... HDMI port 2 now only works sometimes. It wont consistently work for my Nintendo Switch, which was the whole point in buying this TV.  There is an HDMI port 3, but at this point I am going to try to cut my losses and return the thing. One of the main reasons I bought this model was for 3 HDMI ports so I wouldn't have to consistently fiddle around behind my TV.
            "
"32" "Inexpensive for a 4K TV and a good deal for the price. It was a dark picture at first only after I called customer support they took control over the phone and TV and set it up beautifully. The colors are magnificent in high dynamic range (HDR 10 and HLG). I don¡¯t know how they did it yet the colors  are vivid and beautiful.I love my set and have had no troubles since I purchased it. The magic remote is separate and call customer support to find out which model to get. They don¡¯t work with all models. I had to get an extra coaxial cable and two adapters to put behind the set for headphones. I had a red and white plug hooked up to a plug with a two female adapter setup to complete the headphone hookup. It sounds complicated but call customer support and they¡¯ll walk you through the whole process from finding the parts to hooking up the whole thing. It cost around $30.00 extra for the total cost.Even with the magic remote and headphone setup the total price is well worth the cost. I love my set and with all the other 4K sets out there this is a real steal, even full price after the holidays discounts. I like headphones because I can have loud sound privately and not bother anyone. It comes in handy if you live in an apartment and want your neighbors not to hear you late at night watching TV.This TV is perfect for me. Both the cost and  quality. It¡¯s gorgeous and a name brand you can count on. LG.
            "
"33" "The picture quality is superb! I'm really loving the HDR!  The TV was package very well as usual. Thanks Amazon!Pros:- HDR is beautiful. The blacks are actually black.- Easy to understand instructions and an easy quick setup.- Excellent clear & lifelike viewing. Overall great entry level 4K UHD HDR TVCons:- Sound quality- TV legs could be better quality but overall sturdy- Sling app hangs and can freezes the TV from time to time. Could be a faulty app.
            "
"34" "1. I had Amazon prime! It shows me it only take two days to arrive. But It took over a week. Which really piss me off!!! Why I spent that much money on prime??????2. Picture quality is fine. Very dark quality even I tried to light up, doesn¡¯t work so well.3. The stand cane with TV is quite small, very unstable for this size of TV, all plastic.4. Came with back remote, even though it shows on advertisements it comes with different fancy functions, but you need to buy another remote separately!5. Package came without a handle make it¡¯s really hard to carry.
            "
"35" "The TV worked well for a few weeks. Then a piece one of the plastic feet that came with it snapped and the whole thing tumbled off the table it was sitting on and smashed the screen. Amazon told us that because we were past the return window, we should contact LG, LG told us a broken screen was out of warranty despite the fact that a faulty LG part caused the breakage.I won¡¯t be buying any more expensive electronics from LG.
            "
"36" "Just got this setup this week. Absolutely love it. I feel like I should have spent a lot more money for this TV than I did. I'm seriously considering buying a second one for the other room.
            "
"37" "Let¡¯s start out with what I don¡¯t like. The only real issue I have with this tv is that I wish it were a little brighter. I know that at this price point I¡¯m not getting OLED brightness. But the vivid setting is a little too washed out in the blacks to get the level I¡¯m looking for.  One minor nitpickey issue is my inability to get this tv connected to my google home minis. Now, for the good.. I never thought that I¡¯d buy a BIG screen tv. Much less one with both hardwire and wireless connectivity, super easy GUI, and enough inputs (ARC included) to do what I need. I like the thin design and the thin bezels along the edge. The sound output is great although it doesn¡¯t compare to the stereo below it. Setup and installation was a snap and the wall mount I purchased installed effortlessly. I wish the power cord was either longer, or was positioned a little better to allow use of one wire channel (if so used) instead of 2. I may try to order a longer cable just to alleviate one channel more easily.
            "
"38" "A smart TV at an amazing price with great sound and picture quality delivered FREE by Amazon!The remote is cheap and cumbersome. I downloaded LG TV PLUS app on my phone, which is more user friendly.You can also buy a smart remote from LG, I believe.I watch my favorite Youtbe channels and Amazon movies everyday!
            "
"39" "1st. it says 4 ports.  There aren't. Only two.  I could actually live with that BUTTT the tv randomly forgets one exists and stop works all together. I'm a gaming and multiple HDMI ports is an issue. I purchased  KINVIQ so it works for now. However, if the port it's hooked up to now doesn't work I have to reset...Resetting means I have to redownload all apps, update all settings, update all apps, and re-login to each and everyone.I do not recommend this TV.  I generally don't write many reviews but found it necessary this time.
            "
"40" "I loved this TV for the first week. It has quite great quality for as cheap as it is. Unfortunately, however, I noticed two stuck pixels after a week or so. Two isn't enough for a return according to LG's policy so I'm just stuck with two green pixels for good, as none of the fixes I've tried have had any result.Update: I actually did bother to return the first one TV I got through Amazon and purchase a second one. Unfortunately the second one now has a damaged HDMI port less than a week in. It simply will not detect any cord I try to use with it. I am furious.
            "
"41" "Bought this for my daughter for Xmas. Box came in perfect condition. Opened it up, screen looked fine. Plugged it and turned it on picture was black and looked like screen was cracked on the inside.
            "
"42" "I¡¯m not sure if I just got a bad tv but it worked for about 5 hours and then shut down. Screen glitch then the dreaded red blinking light was all I got after that.
            "
"43" "How this TV is listed for this price is beyond me. The picture, sound, interface and quality are incredible. It's so good I got my brother and sister to pull our money to get this same tv for our parents for Christmas.The only annoyance with it is the stupid legs LG uses for this model. My TV packaging also didn't include the screws for the mounting and that was frustrating, but I just chalked it up to a one-off mistake (my parents' tv had the screws). Once those are installed (two people is helpful) then it's smooth sailing from there.Side note, as some reviewers had mentioned, as soon as you set this TV up go to your Settings and TURN OFF the stupid power savings mode. It ruins all of the great features of this TV and any money it would \"save\" you is trivial anyway. This TV is extremely effficient and my energy bill has remained unchanged from my previous TV and it had fewer capabilities than this new one.I love LGs easy-to-use remote where you can quickly access any online streaming with a click of a button. Having separate Netflix and Amazon Prime buttons is also an awesome feature. Everything about this TV is so simple and the picture and sound quality is out of this world.4k in and of itself is a remarkable picture. 4k with HDR is an entirely different viewing experience. The colors variety within HDR is visible no matter what you're watching or playing. It takes 6-8 year old Xbox 360/PS3 video games and makes them years younger. The lighting/color on TV shows and movies makes any of them worth rewatching when it's with a new picture like this. The TV when it's off is true black and looks beautiful just sitting there. Connecting to Bluetooth speakers/headphones is a breeze and is a great option if you want to watch something but need to keep the volume close to you.Aside from the legs and missing screws I have no complaints about this TV. And trust me, I am never shy about voicing issues about products! I have searched high and low and never found a better value for a TV if the $500-$550 range is your budget. It is the gift that keeps on giving. Thank you, LG!
            "
"44" "This is my first 4k TV purchase, as I've been waiting a few years to let them perfect the tech. My 1080p tv's are still great and provide a great picture, but after dipping my toes into the waters of 4k HDR10 I am SOLD! I always go between Samsung & LG but lately I've really liked the LG panels. They just look more lifelike and realistic and the setup is always straightforward and easy to tweak - Samsung menu's tend to be a little more difficult to master IMO.I went with the \"baby\" 43 inch model, which is barebones compared to the higher offerings of the model but included everything I need to play Xbox One X & PS4 Pro in full 4K HDR10. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and in a few years I will be looking to upgrade my main TV to a 4K HDR10 model - most likely from LG & Amazon!
            "
"45" "Maybe I'm just old, but I had the same television for over 20 years and only got rid of it to \"update\". I tried samsung twice and they last a year. This has way better color and way better connectivity over wifi. The issue I have is that it freezes on apps and I'm constantly having to shut off and turn on the tv. Outside of the apps I've noticed some bugs similar to samsung before that died.  I'll leave it a three until it goes, but dang 20 years vs maybe 2.... what is going on?
            "
"46" "This was by far the worst TV I have ever purchased. There really is no way to adjust it, everything is a slight variation of the worst picture. If you like a crisp vivid picture with vibrant color, this is not for you. Amazon was very anxious and understanding to get it out of my house, great service.
            "
"47" "Installed the  new TV and turned it on. The screen was black although the sound was working. After calling LG product support it was confirmed the TV was defective. It appears Amazon won't allow returns on this product so my only option is to call a repair service and have it fixed under warranty. Very disappointing for a brand new TV.
            "
"48" "Alexa does not work!  Follow all the instructions and registration and all you get is the ability to turn off the TV.  Worthless.  Definitely not a smart tv.  I don¡¯t understand why Amazon calls this lWorks with Alexa.¡±  Did anyone actually test it?Very disappointed with both companies.
            "
"49" "I set the TV up, right before I had to go to work. I noticed it look really dim. I have a par of $210 Samsung 32\" monitors (as PC monitors) and they are SO much brighter. I didn't have a chance to really play with the settings until I got home late tonight. The TV is just dim and their are no blacks in it's color output, just dark ashy grey. Push the brightness past 62 and it start white washing the image. I played and played with the setting and couldn't find anything brighter without blowing out the color or white washing the image. After gaming on it for 30 mins I started getting a headache for eye strain.For the average person, this TV might be fine, especially for the current price (I bought it for $345), but for those who have an eye for detail..... A V O I D!Also the tv had faint shadow going around the entire screen and the corners were a bit dimmer than center.This was my first time buying an LG... not sure if I will again. I'm spend a few hundred more and get a Samsung (sigh even with their bloatware) or a Sony.
            "
"50" "I bought this in August and the TV is already going dark .  I called Amazon and they told me to take it up with LG.  Last time I buy electronics with Amazon .  This TV lasted all of two months .
            "
"51" "I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this TV. I had an old LG that I loved, but it checked out unexpectedly. There are other brands that cost less than this one, but I decided to stick with a brand I like a lot, and I'm happy I did. I was a little concerned about setting it up with the TV provider when have, but that was NOT a problem. This is the first smart TV I've owned, and now I know why they're called 'smart'. It practically sets itself up! The default setting has a VERY annoying female voice that guides you through all the set-up. It wouldn't be so bad other than for the fact that she talks so fast you can barely understand her. It's easy to disable that in settings. I like every feature of this TV and highly recommend it if you're in the market for a smart TV. The price is hard to believe for what you get. The quality of the picture if great and the sound quality is also good. So far I've found nothing to complain about with this TV.
            "
"52" "Top of the screen was cracked! What a hassle to have to repack and tray to ship it back. I should have known having a tv packed in the same delivery truck along with other loose heavy items wouldn't be a good idea. Best buy next time!
            "
"53" "UPDATE: After two weeks our screen has gone completely grey.  LG service walked me through troubleshooting over the phone unsuccessfully.  Then they had a contracted tech in our house to inspect the TV within 2 business days.  The tech is suspecting either a mainboard or a screen.  I hope to update you all with better news.I purchased the LG UK6300 prior to Black Friday deals and was very happy with the value and quality of my choice.  I had done considerable research including viewing similar models and styles in brick and mortar stores.  While this TV doesn't have the blackest blacks of an OLED screen, I am satisfied with the picture quality for our family's version of 2-3 hours of casual screen-time per day.  Also, while other screens like Samsung TV's offer much more vibrant colors tuned more for console game systems, I preferred the default pallet of the model.  I do not expect to need or use the higher Hrz rating of premium sets and was pleased with the refresh rate of this model.You definitely will want to pair this with a sound bar/sound system.  While they attempt to \"simulate\" surround sound, it isn't satisfactory.  But if you're in the market for a set, you probably already know that.I can't speak much about the durability, but I was very pleased with the packaging and unboxing instructions.  The Amazon delivery was timely and helpful and my wife and I were able to get it set up in a couple hours with all our apps and streaming settings.
            "
"54" "I really like the picture quality. I have very basic needs for a Tv so this Tv is perfect for me. Quick shipping. Volume is perfect. Have it in my Bedroom.
            "
"55" "First of all, one of the legs broke almost immediately. Like I'd put it on the table and was gently pushing it marveling at how unstable the legs were when I heard a crack and the B side leg was broken. I took it down and purchase a $17 universal TV legs. Those are wonderful and they will get a 5 star review. The other more annoying thing is that whenever I then the tv on I have to reconnect it to the Wi-Fi. I currently do not have it wired in because the modem is so far away, but that'll have to chance because I don't like wasting my time reconnecting it every time I want to watch TV.Edit: after about 2 months HDMI 1 port stopped responding and now today the HDMI 3 port has stopped working. I've never seen a device lose ports like this.

"56" "After 3 months panel had multiple colored dots, called their LG support, connected me to local technician. Three weeks later they finally gave him a reply. They didn¡¯t even send him a new panel so he can fix TV at my place. They sent him a part inside panel so he has to take TV from my home after taking it off the wall, back to his workshop for few days to repair then back to me to mount it again on the wall. So I have to live few days without TV, called their customer service to either get a new panel or a new TV, and they were very rude: it is what it is, that¡¯s policy it else ask Amazon to return back TV (it¡¯s 3 months already so it¡¯s nothing to do with amazon)So my first ever review here, LG I should have bought the Samsung.

"57" "Love my LG 43 inch. Had an old one before, but it died. I like LG, so bought this one. But have it in an amoir, so limited to 43 inches. Hard to find the smaller TV¡¯s today.This one much better than my old one. Picture greater clarity, more vibrant. Streaming interface better, user friendly. Remote smaller and better. Received TV as promised. Highly recommend vendor and TV.

"58" "The product itself is great. How it got to my house was not. We ordered it on Cyber Monday via Prime. It said 2-day shipping. Then, the day it was supposed to arrive at the time it was supposed to arrive it \"magically\" changed to delivery between Nov 30th and Dec 4th. We watched as for days, the TV went from CA, to the Midwest, circled us and went into Canada, before circling us again and then finally arriving yesterday. Yes, we did have bad weather. We had fog, but all I could think about was \"it's going to be broken when we get it after all that travel, and why couldn't it stay in one spot.\"Thankfully, it arrived yesterday in one piece, not broken, and packaged well. Though, I was further frustrated that UPS left it on my front step. However, the outer box was unmarked.Getting this TV has been bittersweet. We replaced our 8-year-old, 36\" Toshiba TV with this one. This is quite the upgrade! Great picture. Great features. Awesome sound. Even my husband who is a computer guy said TV speakers don't usually sound that good. It's thin and light-weight. Though, be careful about the feet it stands on. My husband said others said they break.We used it last night, it works great. I like that it doesn't have to be e the glaring white that some TVs do, and it does out itself to sleep after non-use.Overall it was a great deal to get this TV for $340 on Cyber Monday, and though I wasn't happy with the shipping process, I am glad it made it here ok.
            "
"59" "I had to order this TV twice - the first time the TV came in a box that wasn't broken on the outside, but the TV screen was broken.  I then contacted Amazon and they sent a second TV.  The box for the second TV was broken on the outside, but the TV was fine.  The TV itself is nice.  The picture, colors, sound, etc. is good.  I added a Bose solo 5 sound bar and the sound is great.  I purchased this for my daughter for her 25th birthday and she is very happy now that we have a TV that works.  I would recommend to seller to look at the packaging that they are using to ship this TV, since I've read that others also experience finding a broken screen inside the box.  BTW:  The TV arrives inside the manufactures box and then it is also in an outside box, but the box isn't heavy-duty.  I would recommend purchasing the TV, just be prepared to have Amazon replace it.

"60" "I LOVE itGave it a 4 tho because it tells you to talk to it with the remote.. then tells me I need to buy a \"magic\" LG remote.. like really?

"61" "Just set it up yesterday and so far so good. I am coming from a Samsung and just didn¡¯t want to spend a lot. Like other reviewers said, the legs aren¡¯t the best. I wouldn¡¯t want them for a larger heavier model. I do intend to mount it on the wall in the future but I think it would do fine on the legs. I like the settings menu, it jumps out from the side. You have several presets and can adjust all the usual settings: brightness etc. the sound is great, 10 is too loud. Pretty light as expected. The picture looks great, better than my Samsung, even on old Sanford and Son from the 70s! Connecting to Netflix and amazon is easy and QUICK and there are buttons for both. I don¡¯t use cable btw. Connecting to internet is easy. The menu jumps up from the bottom with all those apps and info as well. I¡¯m pretty impressed with the interface of this tv and I think LG has won me over from Samsung. My Samsung struggled with staying connected to Internet and Netflix etc was always freezing and dropping so I would have to turn it off and back on. I don¡¯t care for the remote it is small and seems cheap. Samsung makes a large remote that¡¯s easy to use and sturdy enough to smack someone with. I have big hands and this remote makes me feel like adre the giant. Bottom line I¡¯m very happy with the tv, I¡¯d buy it again and I¡¯m thinking about getting one for my parents. Good interface, good picture, good price, couldn¡¯t ask for better except the legs. Samsung who?? "
"62" "This is a great TV for the money. It has a great piture and lots of features. Keep in mind this is not an OLED TV so it doesn¡¯t have the best contrast or super deep blacks like all LED/LCD screens. If you set up the picture settings correctly you will have a great picture. There are lots of videos and articles that explain how to do this online. You also have to be using the correct cables. You can¡¯t use regular old HDMI cables. You have to use cables that support the latest and greatest features. You also have to be aware that only 4K content is going to look super amazing. Watching OTA TV, cable, satelitte, DVD, regular Blu-rays, and 99% of all online videos will not be in 4K and su the picture has to be streched yo fill your TV screen. This is called upsampling. You have to set yor picture ssettings for each input. Also setting up the picture settings for 1 app (Netflix for example) sets the same settings for all apps. And if your gaming use Game mode in the picture settings. Game mode has very low input lag.The sound is decent but don¡¯t expect much from tiny speakers in flat screen TV¡¯s. I got a sound bar to get the best sound possible. The TV is easy to set up. Has lots of great features and apps. I was surprised to see Youtube TV which I like. You can share your phone and computer screen but. Not all computers will share though. I have three PC¡¯s and coulld not connect to the TV by adding the TV as a device on the PC settings. But I was able to connect my newest PC to the TV by adding the TV as a wireless screen on the PC. The downside to this method is the sound comnes out of the PC and not the TV. Sharing your phone is easy but you will need to download a Miracast app form the app store on your phone. I was able to stream a movie from my Android phone this way using VLC player. The TV also sees my router and NAS drive as media servers and was able to watch a movie on the TV from the NAS drive. I can also view pictures and play my extensive music collection as well. I also setup Google Assistant on the TV as well. Alexa is also supported. Another great feature is casting Youtube videos from the phone to the built in Youtube app on the TV. This way you can easily pick what video you want to watch on your phone then send it to the TV. This is great for me as I have poor vision and can¡¯t read the text on the TV screen unless I am very close. Oh and for watching movies from the NAS... I have files in the AVI, MP4 and MKV formats. They are all playable on the TV. And for music the TV can play 320kbs MP3's from the NAS. Not sure about other formats.Lastly. I recommend getting the LG Magic remote. It¡¯s not a great universal remote but you can use the remote as a pointer on screen which makes navigating web sites (yes the TV has a web browser) very easy. It also has a voice function which allows you to open apps and inputs and more easily. You also use the remote to use Google Assistant or Alexa. Be sure to turn off Audio Guidance in Settings/Accessibility for the TV as neither the pointer nor the voice function will work with it on.I highly recommend this TV. "
"63" "I purchased this TV as well as an LG soundbar and 4K Blu-ray player to replace a six year old LG plasma 60\" TV that is dying. The TV looks good and was easy to set up including connection to the soundbar. I liked the features, ease of use, picture and user interface and app improvements compared to my old LG. The mounts for tabletop use work, but they are quite minimal. Sadly, this TV started having problems on the second day starting with purple vertical bars on the screen that progressed to multiple color bars ending in no picture or sound. I was on the phone for hours with LG trying to resolve it. Resets and power cycles did not resolve it (not surprisingly). LG's support service is lacking with their referral to non-participating service providers and unreachable providers. After much insistence, my case was apparently escalated, and the issue was to be transferred to LG field support. I was adamantly assured I would be contacted soon on that day. I wasn't. This \"support\" is unacceptable for this product. The support representatives were friendly though, although the inference that this internal hardware issue might be physical damage as not appreciated (presumably as a way to escape support responsibility). It might otherwise be a good product, but with LG's failure to resolve the issue, I returned the TV and Amazon was good in that process. I do not recommend LG now, particularly if you have to get LG support or service.UPDATE: I received a second TV from Amazon, and so far (four days), it is performing well. As with the other one, setup was easy. It works well with LG's SK6Y soundbar and SPK8-S rear speakers. Playing a regular Blu-ray disk on the connected LG UP875 produces an exceptional upscaled picture. My original review was one star due to the early failure and LG's pathetic response. I have added a star for the performance so far of this second TV. I am concerned that it might fail later and I have to try to deal with LG again. "
"64" "Decided to leave Samsung and swing over to LG. Great decision. Great vivid picture with this set. Sound is typical with tv¡¯s being not so great but passable. Set up was easy. Great remote that includes 2 buttons, one for Amazon access and one for Netflix. I would recommend this tv for those looking for a good 55¡± tv with a great picture. "
"65" "The default setting for the energy saving setting is \"on\" which makes the picture very very dark. In my opinion, the default setting should be \"off\", and let the owner decide to use it or not. It took a long time for me to find out it was the energy saving feature being \"on\" which was causing my TV to be very dark when initially setup. "
"66" "Every time I turn it off it loses wifi connection. When I turn the tv back on the wifi is disconnect and it can't see any wifi signals at all, and I live in an apartment complex. I have to unplug the tv every time then plug it back in. Its like the wifi card in it needs to be rebooted every time I turn the tv off which sucks for a smart tv. Tried using a cable instead of wifi. Same problem, losses signal anytime TV is turned off. Have to unplug tv to get it to start having internet again. Unplugging the TV fixes the problem, so I know the TV is the problem and not the internet. Not a smart TV. "
"67" "The first one they sent to me was broken, I was really bummed out...But after I got on the phone with Amazon customer service I was amazed.In a five minute phone call they already had the new TV ordered and on it's way.When I got the TV it was easy to set up right out of the box, phenomenal picture quality...It makes standard television shows burst right out of the screen with crisp vivid color and detail.For the price, this is a no-brainer buy, very pleased... "
"68" "1ST...Easy setup (physically) right out of the box. Slide the stands in place, plug in all your cables and you're ready for step 22ND...The programming setup will walk you through the entire process, but it is time consuming. You will need to tweak some of the factory setting to your preference, and, there are many of those to chose from. For the best performance, try as many as you can.Summary: There is no way to describe the picture of this UHD verses 1080i. Even old western movies appear as new as ever. The sound quality is superb ! I have it connected with my Bose system and it will blow you out of the room ! Great TV with great sound ! "
"69" "Wi-Fi Does not maintain a connection and has to be setup over and over again. TV sucks!!!!!! "
"70" "My last TV purchase was 11yrs ago when we moved into our new house. We just moved again, and even though our OLD TV was working just fine, we decided it was time for something that could handle 4k and offer other features we had read about but never had experienced. The picture on this TV is scary good, like all I could say was WOW and kept calling my wife and kids over to take a look. I added the Wohome sound bar and now the audio matches the picture quality and for only $100 more! What a great tv watching experience, like nothing we have seen before. Thank you LG! Its our very first LG TV and was recommended to me by my brother. He sure gave me a great recommendation! "
"71" " This TV is advertised as having a suite of features which you are can utilize via Alexa integration. This is marketing hype and the product does not do what they advertise. Only 1 Alexa function works - Turns off TV ... nothing else works as advertised.We just installed an LG Smart TV and LG Washer/Dryer. All purchased for the full smart home experience. We have so many other smart home features integrated with Alexa and working fine (GE light switches, Schlage Connect front door lock, Honeywell thermostat, U Moen shower system, window blinds and several other features). So, troubleshooting the occasional glitch in initial integration is par for the course.However, LG completely falls flat on its face. Their \"smart\" appliances are only that in name, not in fact. Despite cycling through repeated efforts of integration (deleting and reinstalling skill, deleting LG account and re-creating, etc) this TV and the LG app would never integrate with Alexa aside from the ability to turn off the TV. The rest of the time the \"TV is unresponsive\".Likewise, the washer and dryer fail to be identified and linked with the LG account.LG has a very long way to go to actually turn this into a working product. They should not be advertising these half-baked features and selling appliances under false advertisement. They have the deep pockets to develop these features correctly before release but they really have not.Do not buy LG if you are wanting the smart home integration experience. You will be severely disappointed.If I would have known of this terrible integration with Alexa I would not have purchased this TV. That was a major deciding factor in why we bought it. "
"72" "So surprised at the picture quality for the price! Viewing 4K content is dreamy! Set up was quick and tv walks you through it after plug-in and power on. Remote included is more than sufficient for me, and magic remote is sold separately but I don¡¯t really know if I want one. Preloaded apps update easily and quickly and include Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime video, with others available for download. Bluetooth function plays music or whatever from your smartphone, sound is good, but I¡¯ll be adding a sound bar at some point. Overall, I¡¯m very pleased! Legs are a little flimsy and require a philips head screwdriver FYI. "
"73" "Really good for the price. My 3rd LG TV. I moved away from Samsung to LG as LG is better quality. Picture quality is amazing. 3 HDMI (for DVD, PS4, PS3, Switch, etc), 1 component (for Wii), 2 USB and one optical audio port. Remote has button for Amazon Prime and Netflix. Some reviews mention that the legs are flimsy, which they are, but they do the job that they are intended to do. Can't beat the price. "
"74" "Usage:Have an AppleTV (4K) and a Nintendo Switch plugged into it. We watch DIRECTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime and various other content apps (HBO GO, etc.) regularly. Owned it for almost a week now by the time this review was written\posted. Doubt continued use will change the review but, you never know¡¦NOTE: TV has latest Firmware\Software installed of 3.00.80 per About TV info at time of reviewPros:Great pictureDecent Sound (as with most TVs of this type, if you don¡¯t like the sound, get a soundbar you do like; one was not connected or used for this review)Has 3 HDMI inputs (though one is on back of TV which can be problematic depending on how you mount the TV to a wall)Once the apps are updated, it¡¯s nice being able to launch Netflix or Amazon with a single click of a dedicated button on the remote if wanted (though we just use our AppleTV for all content anyways).Cons:Having to connect to the internet to update what should be the resident apps (like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Screen Sharing, etc.) before you can even use the apps for the first time.LG Content Store was not reachable thru our Wi-Fi network. Had to tether TV to our cell phone to connect to LG Content Store in order to update the apps prior to first use.No clear way to remove apps you don¡¯t particularly need or want (especially if you don¡¯t use Netflix or Amazon) especially when you see the 500 or so MB of space start going down every time you ¡®update¡¯ an app for the first time you use it.HDMI port 1 now doesn¡¯t function after attempting to use TV temporarily as a monitor for laptop to share content. Port shows no signs of damage, it just doesn¡¯t work anymore.Doesn¡¯t keep Wi-Fi network settings so if you jump from your 5G Wi-Fi to 2G Wi-Fi network connection or tether TV to Cell Phone, you have to re-enter the password every time you change.Unable to get Amazon Echo\Alexa devices to connect to TV.Wired Ethernet Port and one of the HDMI ports (Port #3) faces the wall side of the TV. If you use a fixed mount or tilt mount, this may be an issue if you use these ports. Unfortunately I¡¯m having to use one as my HDMI #1 port doesn¡¯t function anymore.Not necessarily a pro or a con:For those that mount your TV to a wall, you may need to buy a new mount especially if you¡¯re upsizing and have limited mounting spots. The VESA is 300x300. Our slightly smaller TV had VESA 200x200 and we had to switch from a full motion mount to a tilt only mount. For our specific installation, the older tilt only mount we are using is rated for 100 or so pounds and a smaller TV (back when LED TVs were still thick and heavy). If I had to buy a newer tilt only or fixed mount, I wouldn¡¯t be able to mount it due to the distance between my power outlet and HDMI outlet is only 24 inches and mounts for a TV of this size are 29 inches wide and mount would have to go over outlets in order to fit TV above fireplace and below ceiling; not workable.Definitely has the Soap Opera Effect until you turn off LG TruMotion.It would be nice to be able to change to and launch other content providers from the two quick buttons on the remote (i.e. if a DIRECTV NOW app was ever released or someone primarily watches Hulu)Review:If you¡¯re buying the TV to be just a TV, then it fits the bill. If you want to use the Smart TV functions of it, you may experience some ¡®fun¡¯ trying to get stuff to work and if you¡¯re not tech savvy to know how to use workarounds (like tethering the device to your phone), you may get disappointed or irritated by stuff not working with no clear way to fix it. I haven¡¯t tried to figure out how to fix connecting the TV to my Amazon Alexa\Echo device though it¡¯s supposedly certified to work with them though I have the Skill and everything seems to be installed properly (for what I see on the Internet, this problem is a ¡®feature¡¯). As stated above the HDMI port #1 doesn¡¯t work anymore (again, I¡¯ve only owned this TV for 5 days). I have not contacted LG or Amazon yet about this and will update my review if I decide to do so. Another issue that resolved itself is that there was a snack plate sized ¡®ghost¡¯ like area on the screen. I used a paper towel with some ¡®cleaner¡¯ to clean the whole screen and the spot went away (even though it didn¡¯t smear or change when I brushed my finger across it). I¡¯m not entirely sure what it was but I have a couple similar spots in the lower right hand corner of my screen that only show when the screen area is black. I assume there is a protective screen\window that bends\deforms slightly and picks up light being emitted by the TV and that when cleaning it, it bends it differently or nudges it into and\or away from the areas hit by the light. A pure shot in the dark on that issue. The couple 'light' spot do not bother us so it is what it is. If the one spot towards the center-left of the screen didn't clear, that would have been a complete different thing as that would have bothered us. "
"75" "Reading these 1 star reviews and they make sense. There are multiple issues with this TV that needs to be addressed:WiFi / ethernet:This TV does lose internet literally every time the TV goes in \"Standby\" or is turned off. When trying to back to the WiFi after it randomly disconnect it keeps giving you an error stating, \"Unknown error occurred\". I reset the TV to fix this, no change. I would literally have to put my password in for my WiFi 10 times before it worked. Super irritating and time consuming. I decided to put in an ethernet cable into the TV to avoid this issue. I sometimes get the message stating there's no internet somehow... Then when my PCs are sharing media to this TV they lose connection for literally no reason at all. So then I have to turn the TV off and back on again to fix that. Then go through the whole steps of: Device connector, PC, Next, and then pick my device. That's time consuming and irritating as hell.Sleep / Standby:My TV I bought 5 years ago has more features than this TV and is a lot easier to use. Why doesn't this TV have a inactive timer on it that actually SHUTS off the TV and not put it on standby? That's annoying and assuming that uses most of my electric bill. Its annoying to have to set a sleep timer on the TV for something that should have been automatically put on for us. "
"76" "Besides ,or instead of all the usual blah blah boring remarks on specs ,which is already shown about this TV, I will tell you ( as a self proclaimed techie) that this TELEVISION in MY opinion, cannot be matched !And I'm not just referring to it's super reasonable price point , it is by far the best set I've owned in the last 10 years.Okay , imagine setting it up , getting on Wi-Fi, then the next morning you fire the TV up and to your surprise, and GLEE , you have 200 + plus new FREE channels thru LG XUMO !!I was so excited I thot it was some kinda advertising scam or I don't know .I have since 17 years of age ,always fascinated with anything concerning the ship TITANIC ,well lo and behold, the XUMO channels have an actual TITANIC channel !Needless to say I was / am just thrilled about these extra FREE channels, and trust me ,there are MANY interesting and educational channels along with tons of genre's to view.So, in closing, I totally recommend this TV and I believe you will be 1000%HAPPY! "
"77" "Use caseI bought a low-end Samsung 52\" 1080p TV set in 2015 for my den. The idea was that it was only going to be occasionally used, since the projector had been the primary display in that room up to that point. Things change, though, so the TV ended up being the primary display in the room. It had an IPS panel, but the backlighting was not great (uneven, with lots of light bleed), so I replaced it with a high-end LG LED-backlit LCD (opted to not get OLED). That moved the Samsung to the master bedroom, and the oooold CCFL-backlit mid-grade Samsung was nixed in favor of the den Samsung. The main problem is the lack of HDMI ports - with 2, it's one short of what I need (Fire TV, Ceton, and Bluray player). I needed a TV that had good picture quality (IPS), was inexpensive, and either had 3xHDMI (or had some of the equivalent functionality built-in)Packaging/Build Quality/AppearanceAs with most TVs, this one arrived in a massive shipping box. The outer box was relatively nondescript, while the inner box was the one with the bold 4-color graphics. This can be a plus if you're concerned about package thieves. The rest of the packaging consists of various Styrofoam blocks. The stands are located in the top block, each in sheet foam. The manual, power cord, cord organizer, remote, and batteries are all in a bag. The TV has some protective plastic on the bezel and an EnergyStar sticker. The build quality is fine, with no sharp or ugly injection seam lines.Appearance/SetupMake no mistake, this is the bottom of LGs Smart TV product lineup, and is definitely a no-frills affair. The stand is CHEAP - it supports the weight of the TV (which is its job, I guess), but I would not trust it with even a little bit more weight (like someone putting their hand on it and pushing down a little). Higher in LG's lineup, the stands would be made of aluminum... but those TVs also cost quite a bit more. The stands are rotate into keyed holes in the bottom of the panel unit, and secure with two screws (each). As for the rest of the TV, the bezel is a little chunky, and the unit is a little thick (more reminiscent of the CCFL LCD TVs), but it's handsome enough. The ports are split between the side of the unit (2xHDMI + 1xUSB in), and the back (everything else). This setup is fine for a media stand, but you'll need to think about what ports you are going to need if you want to wall mount the TV. The power cable had a right-angle plug, which is nice regardless of how the TV is setup.The setup of the unit is very similar to all other WebOS LG TVs. It first walks you though language and time zone settings, and even asks you about your TV tuning situation (cable box vs. terrestrial vs. other). Next is the networking setup. The TV has both a wifi adapter and wired Ethernet. I would recommend using wired whenever possible, though the wifi seemed fine. The TV got a DHCP address just fine, and you can configure the NetBIOS name for the TV on your network (for Miracast, DLNA, etc.). Side note: as you configure the TV it makes you agree to some of the standard legal stuff, but it bundles in some settings for monitoring you viewing habits - by default, they're enabled... be sure to disable them.On the WebOS side, I updated the Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu clients. They all appeared to look as good and work as well as the equivalents on a 4k Fire TV. Some of the WebOS stuff here and there seems like it was meant for one of the point-to-select LG remotes, but there's only a standard remote present. The remote has quick launch buttons for Amazon and Netflix.As far as picture quality, the TV has a 4k IPS panel, and supports HDR. 1080p and 4k material both looked better than the outgoing Samsung 1080p model, but the color accuracy was not great on the factory settings. When I went to adjust the picture I found a shocking lack of adjustment options. I ended up selecting \"GAME\" and fiddling with the rest of the settings to get to a picture that I though looked a bit more natural. I selected the \"GAME\" mode because there didn't appear to be any other way to turn off the frame interpolation (weird). Granted, you are not really going to have an ISF technician dial in this TV set, but it's just an odd choice to have removed so many of the picture tuning options.A couple wrap up items:1. Sound. Generally speaking, I never use the speakers built in to my primary display, and instead send the audio via HDMI to my receiver. However, in the bedroom, I prefer to keep it simple, and don't use a receiver. I don't use soundbars because they generally only marginally improve the dreadful onboard audio problem with TVs. This TV has above average speakers for the price class. If you pick the right DSP mode, you will have clear sound (the wrong ones will just create a muddy sea of noise). It will be devoid of useful bass and spatial positioning within the soundstage, but what do you expect out of tiny speakers that aren't forward-facing?2. Miracast. It's not that the \"smart\" TV stuff isn't useful, but I think the inclusion of Miracast is an underappreciated feature. Casting from a phone, laptop, or tablet help make up for any holes in the LG's app suite.3. DLNA. This is another one of those things that you either are into, or you have no idea what it is. It's great to put your video and audio assets on a QNAP or Synology NAS, or any number of PC-based DLNA servers. The DLNA client on this TV is pretty nice, and the supported codec set is pretty complete (requiring no transcoding in most instances).ConclusionWhile I'm sure LG can monetize the user viewership telemetry information, I really don't like how it's made to look like accepting more terms of service agreements. Sure, people should read what they're agreeing to, but LG did try to make that setup section look exactly the same as other mandatory items. As for the TV, it's pretty nice for the price. Once adjusted, the picture is quite good. You miss local dimming and some of the fine adjustment settings you'd get at a higher price point. The smart functions provide streaming experiences that are comperable to a base Roku or 4k Fire Stick, but you are a little restricted with the remote. I don't know that I'd buy this to be a primary TV, but I think it's great for something like a bedroom TV. Recommended. "
"78" "I am completely blown away by the picture and sound quality .. especially considering the price point. It did take a bit of tweaking to calibrate the screen to my liking (I also like the fact that you can have different picture settings, per HDMI input device), but I cannot be happier with the overall results. It upscales normal HD to UHD wonderfully.I saw some negative comments about the stand quality, but in all honesty .. I didn¡¯t use it. I needed a pedestal type stand and ordered that separately (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 23-49 inch LCD LED TVs - only $26.99). I¡¯m quite happy about that too. "
"79" "I am quite disappointed with this TV. I bought it to replace an 47 inch LG 3D TV that was five years old and not a 4 K TV. The picture is quite dim compared to the older TV. You really can not watch this TV in a sunny room. The TV is also quite wobbly, so much so that I was afraid it would be knocked over, so ended up nailing the legs using large staples to a wooden TV stand, otherwise I would be afraid that a child or pet could topple the TV. The previous old TV had a heavy metal base (stand) that prevented the TV from falling over. Don't buy this TV if you have small children or pets. "
"80" "I expect a full refund. The feet failed. "
"81" "I purchased the 65 inch. It came with a broken screen. Got it replaced and had the same issue. These are very cheap quality. "
"82" "This has bad reviews for dumb reasons. This is the BEST tv I've ever bought. Jeez! Clean picture, amazing sound, large number of options for picture, sleep mode. I havent even fully explored this tv yet even. the only problem people report is the chord and the screen breaking. the former I havent had problems, the second that's shipping and handling. dont blame lg. you do need to buy the magic remote control which doesnt come with this tv though. "
"83" "The TV will not turn off using the remote in one try. Have to turn it off and wait 60 seconds to see if it comes back on. Same with turning it on. Remote doesn't work well but neither does any of the other remotes synced to operate this TV. Therefore it is a TV problem. Called LG numerous times and all they say is unplug it for 15 seconds. After doing this the remote works once or twice and back to the original problem. You would think LG could come with a better solution...ie take the TV back and send a new one. This problem has plagued this TV since the first day we used it. "
"84" "When my son set it up it worked great. The next day it would not connect to the Internet. My son reset all the settings to get it to connect. Every day, for a week, I have had to reconnect it to the Internet to watch Prime or Netflix. I called LG. They sent a technician out that didn't know as much as I do. He kept trying to connect to live TV, even though I told him 3 times I didn't have TV channels that all I had was Prime and Netflix. He told me I had the wrong remote but the remote he tried to use got a message it wasn't compatible with the TV. He called LG and then told me he would come back later that day after Direct TV came out to set my TVs up for it. He never called and he never showed up. I am so very disappointed as I heard LG was a good brand TV. "
"85" "The LG replaced one of the best TV's I ever had. I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK. I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record. It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV. I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards. This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details, they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar. I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth. I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar. So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed, all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it. One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one. The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV. You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big, Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews. "
"86" "I bought this TV based on good reviews even though there were other TVs with similar features for lower price. It's been only few weeks and I don't have any complaints about the basic and smart features. But the WiFi stopped working after a week or so. After trying several wierd suggestions to change settings found online, I guessed that 5G WiFi could be the problem. I split my AT&T Wifi into 2G and 5G networks with different names and finally the TV was able to connect to 2G network. It's a shame that their 5G implementation is not upto the mark even in 2018. "
"87" "The worst picture quality I have ever seen. The picture has a yellowish tint and all skin tones are washed out. None of the \"advanced\" adjustments would respond. "
"88" "The item was shipped in the TV box, that was also inside another large cardboard box, with plenty of protection from the shipping process. The outer cardboard box did have some holes poked in it but didn't really have any damage to the actual TV box.The stand came with two legs that needed to be popped in, twisted to lock, and screws to make it stable. Not too hard at all to get set up but might need two people to do it if you're not going to have the space to lay the TV on a flat surface on it's back... of course not plugged in while doing so.Sound is quite loud and has many different settings, but don't expect booming bass or anything.Set up wasn't too much of a hassle, nothing to sign up for really just sign into your streaming accounts and surely people know how to do that. The only hassle really is to set up each setting for each device. You will not want the same settings for streaming Netflix as you do playing PS4 Pro/XB1X/Switch/PC. Gaming should always be in Game Mode. That's the longest thing you'll be doing, getting used to the interface/settings/tweaking it all.I have posted some quick photos in my very dark room area and it's amazing. I don't even have the brightness up very high and it's still plenty bright. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it. It's the best budget 4K gaming TV for the brand/price on here. I bought mine for $516 with shipping included. "
"89" "A CR Best Buy, which is why I bought it. Can't beat it for the price, and attaching accessories is really easy using the \"magic remote\". The little legs make me nervous as they do not hold the TV as steady as I would like (it is on a console table), but on the other hand the gap between the legs has allowed my to put the soundbar directly under the TV. "
"90" "It¡¯s a wonderful android tv so far. I connected my devices, Nvidea Sheild, Fire TV, and Roku in the three hdmi ports. Also connected the digital antenna for live tv. "
"91" "First off, let me say that the TV looks good, its features as a smart TV are comparable to my samsung and it was very responsive to remote commands. The TV however falls short in its ability to remain in working condition in less than 30 days. Currently HDMI port 1 does not work at all. The TV will sense a device when you activate the device while the TV is on but will decide there is no signal. The work around to this was using HDMI port 2. Well... HDMI port 2 now only works sometimes. It wont consistently work for my Nintendo Switch, which was the whole point in buying this TV. There is an HDMI port 3, but at this point I am going to try to cut my losses and return the thing. One of the main reasons I bought this model was for 3 HDMI ports so I wouldn't have to consistently fiddle around behind my TV. "
"92" "Inexpensive for a 4K TV and a good deal for the price. It was a dark picture at first only after I called customer support they took control over the phone and TV and set it up beautifully. The colors are magnificent in high dynamic range (HDR 10 and HLG). I don¡¯t know how they did it yet the colors are vivid and beautiful.I love my set and have had no troubles since I purchased it. The magic remote is separate and call customer support to find out which model to get. They don¡¯t work with all models. I had to get an extra coaxial cable and two adapters to put behind the set for headphones. I had a red and white plug hooked up to a plug with a two female adapter setup to complete the headphone hookup. It sounds complicated but call customer support and they¡¯ll walk you through the whole process from finding the parts to hooking up the whole thing. It cost around $30.00 extra for the total cost.Even with the magic remote and headphone setup the total price is well worth the cost. I love my set and with all the other 4K sets out there this is a real steal, even full price after the holidays discounts. I like headphones because I can have loud sound privately and not bother anyone. It comes in handy if you live in an apartment and want your neighbors not to hear you late at night watching TV.This TV is perfect for me. Both the cost and quality. It¡¯s gorgeous and a name brand you can count on. LG. "
"93" "The picture quality is superb! I'm really loving the HDR! The TV was package very well as usual. Thanks Amazon!Pros:- HDR is beautiful. The blacks are actually black.- Easy to understand instructions and an easy quick setup.- Excellent clear & lifelike viewing. Overall great entry level 4K UHD HDR TVCons:- Sound quality- TV legs could be better quality but overall sturdy- Sling app hangs and can freezes the TV from time to time. Could be a faulty app. "
"94" "1. I had Amazon prime! It shows me it only take two days to arrive. But It took over a week. Which really piss me off!!! Why I spent that much money on prime??????2. Picture quality is fine. Very dark quality even I tried to light up, doesn¡¯t work so well.3. The stand cane with TV is quite small, very unstable for this size of TV, all plastic.4. Came with back remote, even though it shows on advertisements it comes with different fancy functions, but you need to buy another remote separately!5. Package came without a handle make it¡¯s really hard to carry. "
"95" "The TV worked well for a few weeks. Then a piece one of the plastic feet that came with it snapped and the whole thing tumbled off the table it was sitting on and smashed the screen. Amazon told us that because we were past the return window, we should contact LG, LG told us a broken screen was out of warranty despite the fact that a faulty LG part caused the breakage.I won¡¯t be buying any more expensive electronics from LG. "
"96" "Just got this setup this week. Absolutely love it. I feel like I should have spent a lot more money for this TV than I did. I'm seriously considering buying a second one for the other room. "
"97" "Let¡¯s start out with what I don¡¯t like. The only real issue I have with this tv is that I wish it were a little brighter. I know that at this price point I¡¯m not getting OLED brightness. But the vivid setting is a little too washed out in the blacks to get the level I¡¯m looking for. One minor nitpickey issue is my inability to get this tv connected to my google home minis. Now, for the good.. I never thought that I¡¯d buy a BIG screen tv. Much less one with both hardwire and wireless connectivity, super easy GUI, and enough inputs (ARC included) to do what I need. I like the thin design and the thin bezels along the edge. The sound output is great although it doesn¡¯t compare to the stereo below it. Setup and installation was a snap and the wall mount I purchased installed effortlessly. I wish the power cord was either longer, or was positioned a little better to allow use of one wire channel (if so used) instead of 2. I may try to order a longer cable just to alleviate one channel more easily. "
"98" "A smart TV at an amazing price with great sound and picture quality delivered FREE by Amazon!The remote is cheap and cumbersome. I downloaded LG TV PLUS app on my phone, which is more user friendly.You can also buy a smart remote from LG, I believe.I watch my favorite Youtbe channels and Amazon movies everyday! "
"99" "1st. it says 4 ports. There aren't. Only two. I could actually live with that BUTTT the tv randomly forgets one exists and stop works all together. I'm a gaming and multiple HDMI ports is an issue. I purchased KINVIQ so it works for now. However, if the port it's hooked up to now doesn't work I have to reset...Resetting means I have to redownload all apps, update all settings, update all apps, and re-login to each and everyone.I do not recommend this TV. I generally don't write many reviews but found it necessary this time. "
"100" "I loved this TV for the first week. It has quite great quality for as cheap as it is. Unfortunately, however, I noticed two stuck pixels after a week or so. Two isn't enough for a return according to LG's policy so I'm just stuck with two green pixels for good, as none of the fixes I've tried have had any result.Update: I actually did bother to return the first one TV I got through Amazon and purchase a second one. Unfortunately the second one now has a damaged HDMI port less than a week in. It simply will not detect any cord I try to use with it. I am furious. "
"101" "Bought this for my daughter for Xmas. Box came in perfect condition. Opened it up, screen looked fine. Plugged it and turned it on picture was black and looked like screen was cracked on the inside. "
"102" "I¡¯m not sure if I just got a bad tv but it worked for about 5 hours and then shut down. Screen glitch then the dreaded red blinking light was all I got after that. "
"103" "How this TV is listed for this price is beyond me. The picture, sound, interface and quality are incredible. It's so good I got my brother and sister to pull our money to get this same tv for our parents for Christmas.The only annoyance with it is the stupid legs LG uses for this model. My TV packaging also didn't include the screws for the mounting and that was frustrating, but I just chalked it up to a one-off mistake (my parents' tv had the screws). Once those are installed (two people is helpful) then it's smooth sailing from there.Side note, as some reviewers had mentioned, as soon as you set this TV up go to your Settings and TURN OFF the stupid power savings mode. It ruins all of the great features of this TV and any money it would \"save\" you is trivial anyway. This TV is extremely effficient and my energy bill has remained unchanged from my previous TV and it had fewer capabilities than this new one.I love LGs easy-to-use remote where you can quickly access any online streaming with a click of a button. Having separate Netflix and Amazon Prime buttons is also an awesome feature. Everything about this TV is so simple and the picture and sound quality is out of this world.4k in and of itself is a remarkable picture. 4k with HDR is an entirely different viewing experience. The colors variety within HDR is visible no matter what you're watching or playing. It takes 6-8 year old Xbox 360/PS3 video games and makes them years younger. The lighting/color on TV shows and movies makes any of them worth rewatching when it's with a new picture like this. The TV when it's off is true black and looks beautiful just sitting there. Connecting to Bluetooth speakers/headphones is a breeze and is a great option if you want to watch something but need to keep the volume close to you.Aside from the legs and missing screws I have no complaints about this TV. And trust me, I am never shy about voicing issues about products! I have searched high and low and never found a better value for a TV if the $500-$550 range is your budget. It is the gift that keeps on giving. Thank you, LG! "
"104" "This is my first 4k TV purchase, as I've been waiting a few years to let them perfect the tech. My 1080p tv's are still great and provide a great picture, but after dipping my toes into the waters of 4k HDR10 I am SOLD! I always go between Samsung & LG but lately I've really liked the LG panels. They just look more lifelike and realistic and the setup is always straightforward and easy to tweak - Samsung menu's tend to be a little more difficult to master IMO.I went with the \"baby\" 43 inch model, which is barebones compared to the higher offerings of the model but included everything I need to play Xbox One X & PS4 Pro in full 4K HDR10. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and in a few years I will be looking to upgrade my main TV to a 4K HDR10 model - most likely from LG & Amazon! "
"105" "Maybe I'm just old, but I had the same television for over 20 years and only got rid of it to \"update\". I tried samsung twice and they last a year. This has way better color and way better connectivity over wifi. The issue I have is that it freezes on apps and I'm constantly having to shut off and turn on the tv. Outside of the apps I've noticed some bugs similar to samsung before that died. I'll leave it a three until it goes, but dang 20 years vs maybe 2.... what is going on? "
"106" "This was by far the worst TV I have ever purchased. There really is no way to adjust it, everything is a slight variation of the worst picture. If you like a crisp vivid picture with vibrant color, this is not for you. Amazon was very anxious and understanding to get it out of my house, great service. "
"107" "Installed the new TV and turned it on. The screen was black although the sound was working. After calling LG product support it was confirmed the TV was defective. It appears Amazon won't allow returns on this product so my only option is to call a repair service and have it fixed under warranty. Very disappointing for a brand new TV. "
"108" "Alexa does not work! Follow all the instructions and registration and all you get is the ability to turn off the TV. Worthless. Definitely not a smart tv. I don¡¯t understand why Amazon calls this lWorks with Alexa.¡± Did anyone actually test it?Very disappointed with both companies. "
"109" "I set the TV up, right before I had to go to work. I noticed it look really dim. I have a par of $210 Samsung 32\" monitors (as PC monitors) and they are SO much brighter. I didn't have a chance to really play with the settings until I got home late tonight. The TV is just dim and their are no blacks in it's color output, just dark ashy grey. Push the brightness past 62 and it start white washing the image. I played and played with the setting and couldn't find anything brighter without blowing out the color or white washing the image. After gaming on it for 30 mins I started getting a headache for eye strain.For the average person, this TV might be fine, especially for the current price (I bought it for $345), but for those who have an eye for detail..... A V O I D!Also the tv had faint shadow going around the entire screen and the corners were a bit dimmer than center.This was my first time buying an LG... not sure if I will again. I'm spend a few hundred more and get a Samsung (sigh even with their bloatware) or a Sony. "
"110" "I bought this in August and the TV is already going dark . I called Amazon and they told me to take it up with LG. Last time I buy electronics with Amazon . This TV lasted all of two months . "
"111" "I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this TV. I had an old LG that I loved, but it checked out unexpectedly. There are other brands that cost less than this one, but I decided to stick with a brand I like a lot, and I'm happy I did. I was a little concerned about setting it up with the TV provider when have, but that was NOT a problem. This is the first smart TV I've owned, and now I know why they're called 'smart'. It practically sets itself up! The default setting has a VERY annoying female voice that guides you through all the set-up. It wouldn't be so bad other than for the fact that she talks so fast you can barely understand her. It's easy to disable that in settings. I like every feature of this TV and highly recommend it if you're in the market for a smart TV. The price is hard to believe for what you get. The quality of the picture if great and the sound quality is also good. So far I've found nothing to complain about with this TV. "
"112" "Top of the screen was cracked! What a hassle to have to repack and tray to ship it back. I should have known having a tv packed in the same delivery truck along with other loose heavy items wouldn't be a good idea. Best buy next time! "
"113" "UPDATE: After two weeks our screen has gone completely grey. LG service walked me through troubleshooting over the phone unsuccessfully. Then they had a contracted tech in our house to inspect the TV within 2 business days. The tech is suspecting either a mainboard or a screen. I hope to update you all with better news.I purchased the LG UK6300 prior to Black Friday deals and was very happy with the value and quality of my choice. I had done considerable research including viewing similar models and styles in brick and mortar stores. While this TV doesn't have the blackest blacks of an OLED screen, I am satisfied with the picture quality for our family's version of 2-3 hours of casual screen-time per day. Also, while other screens like Samsung TV's offer much more vibrant colors tuned more for console game systems, I preferred the default pallet of the model. I do not expect to need or use the higher Hrz rating of premium sets and was pleased with the refresh rate of this model.You definitely will want to pair this with a sound bar/sound system. While they attempt to \"simulate\" surround sound, it isn't satisfactory. But if you're in the market for a set, you probably already know that.I can't speak much about the durability, but I was very pleased with the packaging and unboxing instructions. The Amazon delivery was timely and helpful and my wife and I were able to get it set up in a couple hours with all our apps and streaming settings. "
"114" "I really like the picture quality. I have very basic needs for a Tv so this Tv is perfect for me. Quick shipping. Volume is perfect. Have it in my Bedroom. "
"115" "First of all, one of the legs broke almost immediately. Like I'd put it on the table and was gently pushing it marveling at how unstable the legs were when I heard a crack and the B side leg was broken. I took it down and purchase a $17 universal TV legs. Those are wonderful and they will get a 5 star review. The other more annoying thing is that whenever I then the tv on I have to reconnect it to the Wi-Fi. I currently do not have it wired in because the modem is so far away, but that'll have to chance because I don't like wasting my time reconnecting it every time I want to watch TV.Edit: after about 2 months HDMI 1 port stopped responding and now today the HDMI 3 port has stopped working. I've never seen a device lose ports like this. "
"116" "After 3 months panel had multiple colored dots, called their LG support, connected me to local technician. Three weeks later they finally gave him a reply. They didn¡¯t even send him a new panel so he can fix TV at my place. They sent him a part inside panel so he has to take TV from my home after taking it off the wall, back to his workshop for few days to repair then back to me to mount it again on the wall. So I have to live few days without TV, called their customer service to either get a new panel or a new TV, and they were very rude: it is what it is, that¡¯s policy it else ask Amazon to return back TV (it¡¯s 3 months already so it¡¯s nothing to do with amazon)So my first ever review here, LG I should have bought the Samsung. "
"117" "Love my LG 43 inch. Had an old one before, but it died. I like LG, so bought this one. But have it in an amoir, so limited to 43 inches. Hard to find the smaller TV¡¯s today.This one much better than my old one. Picture greater clarity, more vibrant. Streaming interface better, user friendly. Remote smaller and better. Received TV as promised. Highly recommend vendor and TV. "
"118" "The product itself is great. How it got to my house was not. We ordered it on Cyber Monday via Prime. It said 2-day shipping. Then, the day it was supposed to arrive at the time it was supposed to arrive it \"magically\" changed to delivery between Nov 30th and Dec 4th. We watched as for days, the TV went from CA, to the Midwest, circled us and went into Canada, before circling us again and then finally arriving yesterday. Yes, we did have bad weather. We had fog, but all I could think about was \"it's going to be broken when we get it after all that travel, and why couldn't it stay in one spot.\"Thankfully, it arrived yesterday in one piece, not broken, and packaged well. Though, I was further frustrated that UPS left it on my front step. However, the outer box was unmarked.Getting this TV has been bittersweet. We replaced our 8-year-old, 36\" Toshiba TV with this one. This is quite the upgrade! Great picture. Great features. Awesome sound. Even my husband who is a computer guy said TV speakers don't usually sound that good. It's thin and light-weight. Though, be careful about the feet it stands on. My husband said others said they break.We used it last night, it works great. I like that it doesn't have to be e the glaring white that some TVs do, and it does out itself to sleep after non-use.Overall it was a great deal to get this TV for $340 on Cyber Monday, and though I wasn't happy with the shipping process, I am glad it made it here ok. "
"119" "I had to order this TV twice - the first time the TV came in a box that wasn't broken on the outside, but the TV screen was broken. I then contacted Amazon and they sent a second TV. The box for the second TV was broken on the outside, but the TV was fine. The TV itself is nice. The picture, colors, sound, etc. is good. I added a Bose solo 5 sound bar and the sound is great. I purchased this for my daughter for her 25th birthday and she is very happy now that we have a TV that works. I would recommend to seller to look at the packaging that they are using to ship this TV, since I've read that others also experience finding a broken screen inside the box. BTW: The TV arrives inside the manufactures box and then it is also in an outside box, but the box isn't heavy-duty. I would recommend purchasing the TV, just be prepared to have Amazon replace it. "
"120" "I LOVE itGave it a 4 tho because it tells you to talk to it with the remote.. then tells me I need to buy a \"magic\" LG remote.. like really? This TV is a $1200 TV (I got for $700) && you're tellin me I have to buy MORE stuff <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F610>&& 2 NO HBO GO OR NOW!! Like wtf!? You have EVERY App on this TV known to man! But NO HBO!? Woooooooow!So now I have to move my Amazon Fire box from the bedroom when I want to watch anything HBO on my giant ass TVBut over all.. the sound is AMAZING for basic TV speaker.. a little bit of volume will do you! Most TVs you KNOW you have go buy a sound bar or speaker system cuz the sound sucks! Not this TV! Movie theater quality! I kid you not!&& the picture && the speed between apps is top notch!Fix that HBO thing && we got a 5 star bishop! ¢½ "
"121" "This 49\" is very impressive. The setup is a little time consuming as the instructions are very poor out of the box. But once you find the settings button on the remote, and especially if you use YouTube to watch how it's done, getting the picture quality is a breeze. I'd certainly recommend this product. "
"122" "Love this TV. Of course coming from an 15 year old dynex 55¡± any new tv is leaps and bounds above it. Great picture, works great with the PS4 pro and the 4K is very good. My dad has a Samsung 65 4K and this compares nicely. My fiance loves that it works with Alexa. Easy to set up and use. Great upgrade for football season! "
"123" "I bought this tv to replace my 7 year old one. Unfortunately, I¡¯ve had this for only a few months and already one of the hdmi ports occasionally doesn¡¯t work and the power supply is causing the tv to sputter about once an hour. "
"124" "Very happy with with this TV. I have similar priced TV's (Samsung, Vizio, and Roku) and this is by far the best. This TV is not exceptionally bright but since it is being used in our bedroom and primarily in the evenings this is not an issue but if you plan on using it in a sunlit room you might want to consider a different brand. I did purchase the LG Smart Remote on ebay for $30 and it really works well. "
"125" "I've only had this about a month, but it is amazing to get this for the price offered on Amazon. I don't really use the 4K capability, so I can't comment on that. The picture and sound are very good and it was easy to hang on my wall. I use the smart tv features to access Netflix and Amazon and it works great. "
"126" "I absolutely love this TV. I got it for a Christmas present. I immediately read the bad reviews. Some came broken which honestly I¡¯d give it a one star to if that were the case but my TV was 100% intact. Screen quality is amazing. Colors are vibrant and I can see pores on people¡¯s faces. I mean can¡¯t get much clearer than that! HDMI works for us. However, I have yet to try it with Alexa so I can¡¯t speak to those bad reviews. I didn¡¯t rate the durability because I haven¡¯t had it for long. So we¡¯ll see how ¡°durable¡± it is with time. But overall I¡¯m very pleased with this TV and would definitely recommend buying it! "
"127" "So, received this tv yesterday - haven't been able to hook it up - the legs are definitely cheap plastic as posted in other reviews. One even kept just falling off when I was trying to set it on the surface. And, they are so wide, it didn't fit on top of my dresser that I planned to use. So, I now had to order a center table top tv mount & am waiting for this to arrive, hopefully Saturday. Once i get this tv hooked up and turned on, I will amend my review. "
"128" "I was absolutely floored to see the sticker price on this 65\" behemoth. I figured there had to be some catch, but as far as I can tell, there isn't. I've always had Samsung displays but decided that for the price point, I was willing to give LG a shot and I'm happy that I did.Delivery was performed by a private carrier who was professional and easy to work with. They delivered to us out on a dirt road in Vermont and accommodated my schedule. Before departing, the delivery guys ensured the TV was operational. Perhaps there were too many issues with standard delivery methods (judging by negative reviews stating 'broken on arrival') so this was a welcome change.The picture quality is good. I'm not one to spend hours matching blacks and color balancing, but I'm more than happy with the display. I did notice the \"power saving\" setting would slowly dim the TV during use which I didn't love, so I disabled that feature.The menu system built into the TV is shockingly easy to use. We use Apple TV for Hulu/Netflix/Prime Video/etc., however have started using the TV's operating system for Prime and Netflix, as our Apple TV is not a 4K model.We had a 55\" Samsung that was broken during our move (sad face) and were worried that 65\" would be too big. We were wrong. It is DOPE. You should buy this TV, you will not be disappointed. "
"129" "My old LG was starting to flicker, so I figured it was time to get a new one, especially since the old one didn't support Amazon Prime any more. I chose this size because our bedroom wouldn't take a TV much larger than this.Pros:1. The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous! I couldn't ask for anything better.2. Set up is very easy and user-friendly. I thought I'd have to ask for help, but didn't need any for this TV.3. The only streaming service I use is Amazon Prime, and it pops up immediately. I did have to set it up with Amazon, but that didn't take long. This TV also accesses YouTube, plus many other streaming services.4. The Internet is fairly easy to access and use also.Cons:1. The feet on this TV are lousy. I've had numerous LG Smart TVs, and none has every had such flimsy, wobbly legs. I was so worried about this that I bought a different, more stable TV stand. I wasn't too pleased that I had to spend extra money I shouldn't have had to spend, to correct this flaw. This is the reason I docked this TV a star.Overall, I love this TV, and I highly recommend it, with the caveat that you'll probably want to get a more stable stand for it. "
"130" "At this price point, I don't think you can beat the quality of this TV. I just received it two weeks ago, so I haven't gotten a whole lot of time with it, but so far I'm satisfied. The 4K quality is beautiful, and I'm very impressed by the sound. Typically TVs don't give me what I'm looking for sound-wise so I tend to rely on added soundbars; however, the sound from this TV alone is nice and loud and has a bit of a surround sound quality.My only complaint would be that there's no way to adjust the brightness. Even with the preset \"bright room\" setting, the TV at one point was too dark to view in the day time. I only experience this once, and it may be typical of 4K TVs (this is my first one), but hopefully that doesn't pose too much of a headache. "
"131" "The TV worked fine for all of four days - after that we started getting gray static bars flashing across the top of the screen that only went away (temporarily) when we tapped the back of it.Additionally, the inputs have difficulty working. We plugged in an XBox one, it gave us the option to auto-change over to HDMI port 1. Great. Except when we get there, with the console on, it says it's not receiving a signal. Same with all the other ports (for an xbox that confirmed works with other TV's).And finally, we SOMEHOW managed to get a switch working on it...and there's a SERIOUS delay between the moment you push a button, and the moment anything happens on the TV. Input lag so bad it makes playing video games impossible. We've got a replacement coming in the mail today. Will update (and return) if the issue persists across a new TV. "
"132" "I love, love, love this TV. After setup, it took about a week to get the picture how I wanted it. Between the soap opera effect and the dark color of the screen...I was so close to returning it. But I finally figured out my perfect setting and I LOVE IT! Best purchase made this year. "
"133" "The negative reviews are mostly true. I was a little leery about purchasing this TV sight unseen, and found the reviews about the \"stand\" or \"feet\" to be spot on. Within minutes of unboxing we broke one of the feet after snapping it in to the base of the TV. A minimal amount of weight/pressure while holding the TV snapped the clip that connects the foot to the base right off. Even if we put both feet on the base I do not think they could've supported the TV safely. With kids, and dogs, I was uncomfortable even trying to let is stand by itself. So we gave up and a day later I bought a $70 Stanley wall mount rated for up to 80\" and 150lbs. The mount was a bit of a beast to install properly, but with a little patience we got everything hung and now are happy. Picture is great, and the small bevel makes the overall TV manageable on the wall. DEFINITELY pay extra for a decent wall mount. The feet will not hold, and are poorly made. "
"134" "The 4K picture is fantastic on this TV. It was easy to install and configure and it worked right out of the box.I am not too impressed with the voice features or control from Alexa; but, I wasn't really expecting much in that regard. The remote has a voice feature that is practically useless if you have cable and need to use the cable box remote. I think that a better approach would have been to include a keyboard on the back of the remote, like Vizio does on some of its models. I guess, buttons are expensive.Overall, we are very pleased with this TV. "
"135" "We will not bother to return the TV because it works and it's very big to try to repackage, but if I'd bought it at a store I would, because for someone who is not technically adept the user instructions are so cryptic they are virtually useless.The \"quick start guide\" is all ambiguous drawings, with no text. There is text in the \"manual\" but information is skimpy and assumes you already know what all those ports in the back are for. Here is the entire section on Other Connections: \"Connect your TV to external devices. For the best picture and audio quality, connect the external device and the TV with the HDMI cable.\" Frustrating! "
"136" "I had a Samsung that I loved until it quit working way too early, in my opinion. I thought LG was a good brand. Well, the jury is out. I am not fond of the coloring nor the sound. Good thing I don't use the TV that much. As to the \"smartness\" of this TV, I had to have it installed. The gentleman who installed it is not keen on those \"smart\" remotes either. I am afraid to use the smart portion worried that I won't be able to get back to regular TV. "
"137" "I did my research and decided this would be the best TV for us (ours was bought in 2012 and is starting to die). Amazon said there were only two left in stock at $775, so I purchased it. Not even a day later they seemed to have plenty in stock and at $650! They wouldn't refund me the $125, so I set the first one to be returned and ordered a second. The first had already shipped, so I was happy to just slap a return label on it and have Fed Ex pick it up the day after it arrived. Both TVs arrived on the same day. BOTH of them were broken and BOTH of them had already been opened and picked through. Between the two of them there was one remote and one power cord. There was no Styrofoam and looked like someone had kicked the screens in. Severely disappointed, I have requested an exchange and am waiting for a reply. It took two weeks for them to arrive, so I'm hoping I will have the new one before the month is out. Hopefully, it will be intact. I'm sure Amazon will remedy the situation, and when they do I will update my ratings. I am certain these TVs are solid and I'm very excited to have one. "
"138" "This is a solid TV, but I wouldn't play full price for it. I got it on a Black Friday sale and for that value it was 1000% worth the upgrade. The image is sharp and the color reproduction is good - but neither are going to blow you away when you compare them to more expensive TVs. Further, and perhaps my biggest qualm with the TV after some extended use, is that it just can't produce blacks as deep as I would have liked.In general, while I didn't regret the purchase, I was actually fairly surprised - I upgraded from a 2007 LG HDTV to this one. You'd think there'd be a bigger jump in visual quality from a 12 year old 720p HDTV to a 1 year old 1080p 4K HDTV, but there just isn't.If you have a few extra hundred bucks to put towards your TV, I recommend shopping around before landing on this one. It won't let you down, and it's got all the handy SmartTV features of the day, but there are definitely better options out there. If you're a videophile and you demand an image so sharp you can cut your fingers on it, or extremely accurate color reproduction is important to you, or you need your blacks to be super deep, this is not the TV for you. If you want a 4K on a budget, shop around and then come back to this one. "
"139" "So I get the tv, I pay around $100 to get it all set up on my wall, I'm all excited and turn it on and... it's not a smart tv. Turns out I got some 2013 model that just came in the box of the 2018 smart tv model. Spent at least an hour with customer service, and all they're going to do is arrange for someone to pick up the old tv and give me a refund. Luckily my handyman was still in the building and I could get him to take the tv down and offer to put the new one up for me, but I now have to wait for the new tv and go through all the hassle of setting it up, not to mention the hassle of handling the return of the tv I have and the hassle of my handyman who keeps saying I should have gone to Best Buy.Update: I've finally gotten the new tv and it's working okay, but apparently it'll stop supporting Hulu starting next week? No warning, either, just found out because my Hulu app stopped working and I was trying to delete the app and reinstall it "
"140" "Far to many times I need to reset the TV. Can not find the HDMI connection - NO SIGNAL MESSAGE - Buy SAMSUNG do not do what I did switched to LG. Now I am stuck with this and could have bought a Samsung cheaper at Costco. "
"141" "The picture quality is fantastic. The sound is great for having no external speakers. My trouble is it¡¯s ability to connect to a network. It simply struggles. We have had to move it to a different room to have it close to the router. It still has to be reconnected almost every time. Was hoping for a smart TV with good wireless capability. We are just going to wire it via Ethernet. Hopefully that fixes the issue. "
"142" "After all the great reviews for this TV, I got it for a Black Friday Sale to replace a 32 inch Samsung.Took it out the box, connected my PC, PS4 and Xbox One consoles. PC color washed out the next day and connected that to my 49 inch TCL Roku TV. Installed a software update 3 weeks later and found the sound and color improved for the consoles. A week after, the signals from the consoles don't register but do work on my TCL Roku TV.Disappointing product from LG. I guess I'll get another TCL Roku TV. Once I get my refund. Or maybe they may offer to replace the same item for one that works. "
"143" "Great screen quality. I've never had an HD/4K tv before and it's very clear. "
"144" "looks great, brings older movies to life, 4K is amazing. They have an app, and claim it works with alexa, couldn't get either to work, but the TV is great. "
"145" "Very nice tv, delivery was fast, it arrived securely packaged by ups. The view is clear and the sound is amazing. Includes games, music, etc.Setup was simple as well, I am very happy with my new tv. "
"146" "Unit will not power up. LG support determined the unit is defective.Third attempt to get a replacement failed. Will try again later.Fourth attempt to set up a return failed with this message:An error has occurred, but rest assured, we¡¯re working to resolve it as quickly as possible.If you¡¯re trying to check a return's status or print existing return labels, please visit Your Orders. To request a new return, please check back soon.We apologize for the inconvenience. "
"147" "Cool TV but for some reason i have to switch the port my HDMI is every so often otherwise it wont show the picture. "
"148" "I like this screen because of it's convenient sized for my small space and clarity of image. It was an easy one person install because if its light weight. However, light weight comes at a cost. during the assembly excessive pressure cause one of the feet to snap off. I was able to reattach the foot with a simple 1/2\" screw, I was greatly impress by the image quality but somewhat disappointed by the low 20 watt audio output. This was corrected by adapting my analog stereo system with a bluetooth audio module. This allowed seamless connection be between the old and the new. Overall I'm very satisfied with this 4K UHD capable TV. I only wish there was more available free 4k and UHD streaming content. "
"149" "TV is perfect size for our med/large bedroom. Didn't like the type of leg supports it came with, as so many do these days so, I ordered a separate adjustable, back mounted, swivel TV support stand which works GREAT. Picture is VGood. I used the HDMI plug/hook-up option. Set up TV functions to our liking and integrated with my local cable carrier like a duck to water.No Problems. I did get warranty insurance for it though, just in case. - Murphy's Law. "
"150" "This is our first smart tv so we had a learning curve most people wouldn't have to get set up, but it works great and has a very nice picture.LG 43UK6300PUE 43-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2018 Model) "
"151" "I purchased this TV for my grandpa who is now living in a care facility with limited space in his room. We purchased a Bluetooth speaker so he could watch TV without it being to loud. My family set everything up but we were disappointed to find out we need to additionally purchase the LG Magic Remote to setup the Bluetooth speaker. Otherwise the TV is great. "
"152" "Incredible quality. 4K HDR looks amazing. "
"153" "It came a day late but it was worth the wait this is my first smart tv and all I can say is woow I got me a 49 and this is a nice size it shows a great picture too I love it all ready and if I have any problems I will let y¡¯all know also it was a great price it doesn¡¯t come with a magic remote so don¡¯t get mad "
"154" "After a month TV will not connect to internet, contacted seller they deflected to lg. Lg support is trash on hold for 1.5 hrs and they couldn't solve problem "
"155" "So purchased this in July 2018, connected to Amazon Echo in December 2018. Had real had time connecting. Had to reset TV and Alexa mutiple times (this was with Alexa Tech Support & LG Tech support in a 3 way phone communications). Their professional opinion it¡¯s not as easy as advertised. TV wasn¡¯t defective just very difficult to connect to Alexa Devices. The big thing u still can¡¯t use Alexa to TURN IT ON, The TV will not turn on without help of remote. So gotta have TV remote out all the time. Kinda defeated the purpose of getting TV.LG¡¯s response is o well it does everything else. Very disappointed. "
"156" "Bought this 43\" TV for my office. It wasn't difficult to set up. The picture quality is very good. The television didn't come with wall mount screws. The screws that come with the TV are for the table top legs. The instructions say to use an M6 screw, but I didn't notice that when I was trying to mount it. Since I didn't notice the screw size on the instructions, the next day I ordered the $11 LG TV wall mount screw set on Amazon (Universal TV Mounting Hardware Pack) which has all sizes and lengths included. It turns out that the instructions don't indicate screw length so it was fortunate that I ordered the entire set since there were a number of lengths of the M6 screw in the pack. The screw required on this TV is M6x20. Now I have a great variety of wall mount screws that will find their way to the back of a drawer, never to be seen again! If you can find that screw when you order this TV order it, otherwise you will wait for the screw kit (or the M6 x 20 if you can find it) to arrive after the fact. I guess if I went to the hardware store they might have known what an M6 screw was, but without dragging the TV to the hardware store you'll not know what screw length is needed. So if you impulse buy this TV for a Super Bowl party give yourself a couple of days or you won't be able to mount it in time. "
"157" "bought this one because it has a great picture & fabulous audio. Settings can be confusing, but all new Tv's are like that. YES, I bought buy it again & again! "
"158" "Purchased in July and December one of the hdmi ports stopped working. This TV only comes with 3 so that¡¯s a big deal with limited options for a home theatre system. I¡¯ve had a Sharp Aquos since 2009 and all hdmi ports are still functional. "
"159" "First one arrives all smashed up even though packaging was fine. Second one was fine, and it's a good TV. The sound-out is a bit fiddly and audio delay range isn't enough (goes positive but not negative). "
"160" "My only complaint is with the delivery time. I am really tiring of being an Amazon Prime member expecting 2 day delivery only to be surprised by delivery taking 5 days. I have come to realize that 2 day delivery is not really free, prices of items are quite ofter higher than retail, but I'm willing to pay it to get my stuff quickly and easily. This was a real disappointment, I'm not sure if it's the seller or Amazon to blame. I could have purchased this TV at Best Buy, five minutes from my house for $25.00 less. "
"161" "The 4K quality is the best at this price. I bought another Samsung TV at Best Buy and this was much better. The 4K and HDR capabilities are very nice. "
"162" "We'll have to do an update later but so far we're happy with the product. It's our first HD TV after only having SD so it's been a little frustrating trying to figure out all the adjustments. I still miss the older TV screens that don't gray with angle viewing, but am aware this is common. I've seen much worse and the research I did for picture quality comparing many brands, this one is rated well overall for it's size. We have not connected it to WiFi so cannot comment on that aspect yet. "
"163" "The image quality is great, maybe even a little bit better than I expected. At the price, I thought \"why not?\"Only weirdness is using the apps on the TV itself to watch things. The video through the onboard apps looks sped up like it's at some weird frame rate.My solution was to to buy a Roku Ultra 4k streaming box paired with the latest HDMI HDCP 2.2 or some such cable.Worked like a charm. Video looks like normal frame rate. Also helps to have your streaming device wired instead of wifi.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this TV again. "
"164" "My dad did a ton of research, because that's what he does and he's retired now so I solicited his help. For the price range, this was by and far the best deal and I couldn't agree more. It's a wonderful TV. I bought one for my studio, and then my living room TV crapped out on me... so I bought another one, because I like it so much. I actually canceled an order for special speakers to go with it because it turns out the internal speakers are pretty dang nice, which was a nice surprise. "
"165" "I have had this TV sense September and its a really nice TV. Decent built in speakers and good picture quality. The issue that I have come across is the HDMI controller doesnt seem to be working right any more. It will detect things plugged in to them but will not push the video. I have found this is a common issue and after unplugging the TV for 10 seconds it detects the HDMI port video again. "
"166" "Lifelong LG lover here and this product came exactly as expected.pros: Quality is great streaming HD videos and I use it for editing some Adobe Premiere files also. For the price you cant beat it.Light as can be ( expected ) . I hung this in my office. easy installation.Cons: Almost noneThe live zoom feature just seems so stupid. I still cant think of a scenario where I would need this.One star knock as I still think the remote functions should have a \"keyboard\" option on the back or an optional one. They used to opt for the weird WAND remote that essentially was the cheaper version of doing it, but I think they need to up their game there still, especially for internet browsing... "
"167" "until you watch something natively shot in 4k on a 4k tv you don't understand. the picture quality is amazing, even hd blu rays look incredible. get this tv and then upgrade your Netflix subscription and most of the new shows/movies are all in 4k. you can now rent buy movies in 4k on amazon video as well. "
"168" "Easy to set up however whoever programmed The Voice should have had it where Youmans can understand it instead of speaking at 200 words per second. Two people needed to take it out of the box came shipped in an outer box to protect the TV and all is good haven't hooked it up yet waiting for cable to come so can't really comment on the picture but so far so good "
"169" "I love this TV. My old LG decided to no longer show the screen, but you could hear it. This TV is its replacement. It is not as nice and fancy as my old one but it is big and does a great job. I love the extra USB ports on the side as well "
"170" "Nice TV but every day it loses cable, sometimes several times a day. We have to unplug it from the cable box to get cable. Amazon prime always work. I know it is the tv because we have another smart tv and it works with cable just fine. We changed settings and we .are still having the problem. "
"171" "Brilliant picture, colors and sharpness. I have used the Fire TV often and frequently. The picture looks even better when you step back from the TV.Only complaint is about the sound. It's rather weak with any ambient noise tending to drown it out. I'm looking to get a sound bar for it.Great buy. "
"172" "This is my second LG Led my first one cost $1,200.00 for a 50 inch screen. It has a perfect picture; this is even better. The WiFi lets me use this for Netflix and Amazon video and browse the internet . I purchased it to hook my second security system in my backyard . I needed to setup the system closer to the backyard to get closer to my 8 cameras, when I hooked it to the front TV the cameras would drop off due to the distance from the wireless cameras .Now the cameras stay on all the time and I have a great bedroom TV. "
"173" "We purchase this TV in December and are quite pleased. In the beginning, the picture takes a little time to adjust but eventually settles down. The set-up is a bit more complicated than necessary but quite workable. I disagree with some reviewers that criticize the \"Smart\" media. Personally, I kind of like all the added channels and had no issues with Netflix, Hulu, You Tube or Amazon Prime movies. The TV quickly linked to my 2G but did not recognize my 5G wireless network. Still, the speed seems plenty adequate "
"174" "Do not buy this TV - I do NOT write reviews but feel the need to do so because this TV is THAT bad. As far as picture, sure, it looks good. As far as internet connection..... its nonexistent. You will have to constantly reconnect to the internet every time you turn your TV on, and that's IF your TV even recognizes any WiFi network around. I have another TV in my bedroom, far away from my WiFi router, that has absolutely no issues with connectivity. It is not an LG. I have never in my life been so disappointed in an electronic device. It is not worth the money, or time on the phone with LG. "
"175" "Upset that the apps not working specifically the Amazon prime video app. Which is weird because this TV is an Amazon special .. "
"176" "The picture on this TV looks great, however the connectivity is terrible. Netflix or another streaming service will play for a few minutes and then will stop citing no internet connection. I know it is not a problem with my internet because other devices continue to stay connected. Additionally, if you plug in an Apple TV the connectivity is fine. You have to go into settings, retype your password and try again. It usually does connect at that point, but again, only for a few minutes. Very frustrating. I would not recommend this TV unless you want to also purchase an Apple TV or another device to make it work. "
"177" "Picture tube went out called for support no reply "
"178" "Bought this as a replacement since the bulb went out in our last TV. The smart features are a really nice addition. They're easy to navigate through, and are great when you have some other streaming services. The colors look great, and really pop. The picture quality is fantastic. I was between this and a samsung, but this was a bit cheaper, and is most likely going to be the same quality. "
"179" "Great TV for a great price! Love everything about it. Would definitely recommend it! "
"180" "Beautiful Picture, just the right size for our bedroom! My top recommendation+++ "
"181" "The two small pieces on either side were missing. No way to use the TV without them other than buying separately. Annoying! "
"182" "I had a Samsung but wanted a bigger screen for my new house. Spent so much money moving from California to Texas and bought a house. This is as good if not better then my Samsung very clear picture sound just from the tv is not bad. Has 4HDMI PORTS WHICH IS GREAT "
"183" "Sound is not great. Had good picture and I love all the extra features but have to unplug every once in a while so it updates or else the apps and other features dont work. I knew I would have to do that but we have had it for less than 2 months and have had to do it like 5 times already "
"184" "I almost didn't get this TV because of some of the negative reviews. It is a great TV and you can't beat it for the price. I am very happy with it. I like the connection with the WiFi for Netflix and Amazon. The Channel+ from LG has a wide range of channels as well. Easy to operate and great quality. This is my third LG TV and all three are working fine. "
"185" "Happy camper here! This TV is far better than my last...everything very easy to hook up...and I cannot wait for college football to start! "
"186" "Very happy with the purchase. Packaged very well. Solid TV for the price. Took a bit to figure out how to get the picture looking right but once I shut of the energy saving feature it was all good. Can¡¯t tell you much about the sound because I always rely on my sound bar. I recommend a sound bar and subwoofer for any entertainment set up as it is always night and day. Gave it 4 stars because that means it¡¯s perfect and nothing is perfect. If your looking for a new TV and want to stay under $1,000 this is it. "
"187" "This LG has an amazing clear picture, and the colors are vibrant, one of the BEST 4K tvs on the market, and a great price for under $270, considering the great quality. Very happy with purchase. "
"188" "I've had it a couple of months and love it. Easy to set up & great picture quality. "
"189" "We bought this for a present for a family member. She was delighted at the picture quality, it looks so real that I want to replace my TVs that I bought last year that are not Ultra HD. Sound quality is okay, nothing that a sound bar won't fit. We have had a lot good luck with LG products in the past and will continue to purchase them. "
"190" "First one was delivered broken, but the delivery guy was the one who insisted on unboxing. No clue where I would be if he had left after I opened the box. Customer svc was already done, I just had to re-order. Painless, minor inconvenience as opposed to renting a vehicle with enough back seat space for this thing.the actual product:Like being in a Drive-in. has all kind of stuff like amazon & netflix right on the remote. Sound is lovely. Toughest thing was mounting it on the entertainment center I got specifically for that :) is a 2 man job "
"191" "It looks amazing and I can use it to play my pc games. However, that¡¯s all I can do not it!!! The hdmi only wants to work with my pc and works with my switch whenever it feels like it and I can¡¯t even connect to the internet on it like it¡¯s supposed to "
"192" "What a great purchase! I have really nothing negative to say about this product. I¡¯m extremely happy with the quality overall. You can watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, You Tube, any app really. The picture quality is comparable to our main (very expensive TV). If I need another TV again, I¡¯ll get one like that, no doubt. "
"193" "I love the picture quality and I have a super uhd tv as well, same brand. I can't tell the difference between them thus far. I the picture quality seems the same to me. I have a LG sound bar so I haven't used the sound for the tv yet it was light and was easy to set up. It makes my living room the center of the attention, and I love it. "
"194" "The optical out port failed to function so I could not connect it to my Boes sound system, and the video quality was poor. I adjusted the video several times and after five or ten minutes it degraded again. I contacted Amazon and returned the TV the next day. They sent me a new one within a few days and it works well. I like the new TV and I am very pleased with Amazon¡¯s service. "
"195" "Ordered product online to save 20.00. should have tested all the HDMI ports before letting my son take back to college. Product also has static charge noise. Want to send it back but son away at school. Don't get burned test all the HDMI ports and the sound. Bet this was refurbished. "
"196" "Picture and sound quality gives a new experience to any content being viewed on it. Had it for more than a year and haven't had a bad experience with it. "
"197" "The picture and sound are superb and the TV is small and light enough to be carried by one person. I highly recommend the purchase "
"198" "I just received this TV yesterday - setup was very easy/intuitive and after customizing some of the picture settings I was very happy with the picture. The sound is also surprisingly good and loud for such a thin TV.The one thing that I am absolutely dissatisfied with about this TV is the horrendously cheap feet that hold the TV up. If you're mounting the TV this obviously won't be an issue, but one of the feet snapped during setup while I was plugging a cable in. Even while the feet were intact, the TV wobbled way too much more comfort. Luckily I was able to catch the TV before it fell, but I'm still very disappointed in how awful the feet are. "
"199" "I do not have cable or a dish. I have an inside antenna, YouTubeTV and Amazon Prime and the picture is excellent with all. I have had no problems and I love my new TV. "
"200" "I like how easy this TV was to set up and plug and play. However I do not appreciate the quality it was delivered to in. There is either damage from shipping or a defect in the upper left corner. I have a repair case open with LG, I took photos documenting the damage and have uploaded them into the case I have with LG. I hope I get some good customer service otherwise this will be the 2nd TV I have purchased through Amazon that came either defected or damaged. "
"201" "I have had three 65\" TVs so far and this one is by far the best I have ever owned. It has an app store instead of preset apps. The built in wifi receiver is plenty fast and it has a ethernet port for wired internet (very little difference). This TV is less than 50 lbs making it easy to move by yourself. My only complaint is it's small plastic feet that come with the TV seem pretty frail, I really wish LG would have kept the metal ones like on their previous model "
"202" "We saw this in a store and everyone was out of stock on the size we wanted. We really liked the picture so we searched online and found it here on Amazon. After setting up the TV we noticed the sound wasn't great but that was easily fixed with a sound bar. What we found most disappointing is that only 2 of the 3 HDMI ports work on a brand new TV. "
"203" "Love the tv. It¡¯s a wee bit difficult to set up without a magic remote, however.I¡¯ve ordered one. Hopefully we¡¯ll have smooth sailing after it arrives. "
"204" "Exactly what I was expecting. Great for the price. Quick delivery, and perfect condition.Update: the tv still does not connect to my Alexa as advertised. But everything else is awesome. "
"205" "we have only had this for a month, but so far so good. hooked it up Christmas day and the resolution and features are wonderful. Highly recommend it so far! "
"206" "I am very disappointed in this tv. After about one month of use, a vertical line appeared in the screen that is now visible all the time. "
"207" "I'm glad we waited until this year to replace our old SD TV. The picture quality is amazing, the size is perfect for our family room and the sound quality is good. We don't need to add a sound bar to have good quality audio, and that is a plus. I would recommend this TV to anyone who wants a great TV for the price. "
"208" "I bought this TV specifically to work with Alexa. Come to find out there are only two commands that are functional with Alexa and this LG TV- Turning TV off and volume control. Alexa cannot change channels or turn TV on. I talked with costumer service to confirm this (not sure if I was setting the TV up wrong). The customer service agent confirmed that these two functions are the only ones that work. Beware - their advertising is very misleading! VERY DISAPPOINTING! "
"209" "This is my first flat screen TV in my bedroom. It is just right and has a great picture. I got it in Nov. but waited to write a review. It seems I find out more and more about my TV on a regular basis. (you can teach an old dog new tricks, lol) It was easy for my son to set up. Not much more than plugging it in and a few minutes later was ready to watch. It was not a high price tele but for the size it suited me to a tee. "
"210" "The picture quality is great. Bought this model due to sales on prime day, 2018 model and work with alexa. The cons side will be the tv is shaky with the leg mount fit. "
"211" "Love the packaging.. Its ok for price.. I expected to be of better quality.. Make out of some cheap plastic.. Light weight..was no LG logo at the back.. My mom first lg tv is make out of better quality "
"212" "Very solid TV with excellent picture and (if you invest in the Magic Remote), a joy to operate. Highly recommended! "
"213" "Sending to the shop accessory color gone out. "
"214" "Good looking picture. The unit came as advertised and looks great. Mounted on a swing out bracket and looks good on the wall. The sound comes out the bottom/back of the TV and while it sounds good behind the TV, it isn't great out in front. It is mounted on a swing out support that doesn't allow the sound to \"bounce\" against a hard surface perhaps like it normally would, and for what I'm using it for it is fine. If it bothered me I would most likely get a sound bar with this nice a TV anyway. Good TV. Can't speak to durability - I've had it about 2 weeks. "
"215" "Dead pixels in the first year. Small but doesn't make me feel good about the future. Sound problems, there's maybe 10 different sound features and most of them need to be turned off to get rid of audio delay. Random neighbors try to connect to my tv, hard to disable that feature, extremely annoying. "
"216" "Would be 5 stars except the stands broke on it before I even got a chance to turn it on which is frustrating. Shipped timely. Great tv for a great price. Easy setup. Great picture and sound. Works great with the apps. But needed the stands because I don't plan on renting for much longer and didn't want to put big holes in the wall for a wall mount. So it's frustratingly sitting propped up on my entertainment center. Might upgrade to a 5 star review after receiving help from customer service. "
"217" "Good price, good quality. I watched this TV for 5 months, I can not find any defects. Everything is good. All function works perfectly. "
"218" "Good picture, easy set up. Probably spying on me but if LG really wants to hear the noises I make sitting on my couch I guess that's their problem. "
"219" "Perfect picture and awesome colors. I am very satisfied with my new big screen. Quick delivery, easy setup. "
"220" "Decent tv and a very decent quality picture. My husband and I enjoy watching movies on this and playing our video games. Nothing came broken so I was very happy and pleased with that. I would recommend this television as it also is very affordable "
"221" "This is my first ¡°smart¡± tv. I really like the sound and quality. The actual dimensions were given in the description which helped tremendously in deciding on the purchase. It had to fit into a built-in unit and it¡¯s true to the given dimension. "
"222" "I love it. I have never had a smart tv before. So i am very exited with this product! Everything works perfect "
"223" "Had it for 30 days and the screen just died. Went black on one side and spread across the screen "
"224" "I love the TV, but it won't hook to my wireless unless I downgrade my security setting. That is a NO GO so I purchase a Fire Stick now it can work. But I would prefer both to be honest. I like google movie options better and we all know the fight google is having with amazon. The picture is great though and the sound works well. "
"225" "I bought this tv in August and am still blown away with the picture! It just jumps off the screen .Everyone who comes by says they feel like the picture is ¡®right there ¡®and so clear I definitely recommend this tv! "
"226" "Good picture. I have a larger version of the same TV, but too big for the bedroom, so this was it. I rarely game, but tried out the 4k and it's an amazing picture. I was surprised by the smoothness, for the price. "
"227" "My tv came with a cracked screen. The only reason I'm giving this product 2 stars is because I love LG. I love their phones and other products but this one was a huge disappointment. I'm returning and exchanging the tv and I'll likely change this review once my new tv has arrived.Edit: My new TV has arrived and as expected, LG redeemed itself. I love it so far and I hope it stays that way! "
"228" "This TV was for my special needs daughter to easily watch Netflix and Amazon. The TV has a beautiful picture and easy to setup. Be sure to find the base screws to tighten the base to the TV. Even them we found the TV to be rather unstable and have tied TV to a wall to keep it from toppling. Setup was idiot proof. The Amazon price was same as Costco sale, but thru Amazon had UPS delivered to our daughter's home for free (Prime). "
"229" "Love this TV! Built in Netflix and amazon prime have been great! Also works fantastic w/ my Apple TV! "
"230" "I bought this TV mainly because of price and availability... but wow, what a great picture and refresh rate! The sound lacks bass a little but nothing a soundbar couldn't fix. Totally satisfied customer. "
"231" "This tv has a great picture! Bright, crisp an clear picture! Just turn the energy saver off an its brighter "
"232" "I received no power cord or screws to mount it so I have no idea of my tv's quality!I have had a nightmare in the phone trying to get those things.The tv came with o ly the stands which I won't use. "
"233" "The HDMI ports burned out except for one. This TV was too expensive for a stupid malfunction like this. "
"234" "I purchased this lg 65¡± tv a few months ago. At first I thought it was great. However recently I have noticed an extremely iratating ringing in my ears. When I don¡¯t watch the lg tv for a day the ringing in my ears goes away. However after not watching the tv for a day and watching it again the ringing in my ears returns. I have tried this several times and the results are always the same. I will be getting rid of this piece of junk and never buy another lg product. It¡¯s really a shame because the picture is beautiful. "
"235" "Ordered this TV and it worked for about a day when a 1 inch flashing bar came across the top. It was clearly a defective device so I exchanged it.2nd TV arrived and within 2 hours of use, same issue. I¡¯m not sure if this is a known issue but I would not recommend. "
"236" "Volume is at 12 and can hear the tv clear as day. Picture quality is very good. "
"237" "I bought this Smart television as an up grade from my last LG smart television. I wanted a larger screen and I was not disappointed. No damages and was assembled by the folks who delivered the product. "
"238" "This screen is not as bright and color adjustment is not as I expected.Otherwise, it is a five star.Seeking assistance in adjusting brightness and color, beyond the settings on the TV. "
"239" "Bought 2 of these, one 49\" and one 43\" ... both have great picture, and both have Bluetooth audio out (which for us was a must have feature). Docked these TV's one star due to their claim of being compatible with Alexa ... was never able to make connect the TV to Alexa ... gave up trying. "
"240" "I love the picture on this tv, sound is acceptable for a living room setting. Follow the instructions to install the stand, it¡¯s a two person job but makes sure you never put pressure on the screen. The stand is somewhat sturdy, a drawback being they are on the edges of the unit. Finding a piece of furniture long enough to put it on is a challenge. "
"241" "Great price and it looks fantastic. I got this for the new Xbox One X and the difference is pretty spectacular. Netflix is now sucking up my data whenever 4K is involved but it's worth it. And Red Dead looks crazy crisp. "
"242" "Easy set up. Excellent picture. A very nice product. "
"243" "The device simply cannot maintain a connection with the internet w/AT&T as the ISP because of a LG software problem. LG has provided no patch or assistance with the issue. It is common as can be seen by the various forums. Will not purchase an LG product again. "
"244" "Even though it is not expensive, but everything about this TV is beautiful. Scrreen, sharpness, sound, control. It is just a gorgeous TV. It is such a great deal to have this TV at this price. "
"245" "The sound reminds me of am radio. My sharp 24 picture is better color sharpness 4k CANT BE. THAN THIS LG4K. MISSING SCREWS. For my stand so icalled lg customer service for help. I was to find or go to the hardware. Store .i wish AMAZON OR LG WOULD BUY MY TV. LG AND SAMSUNG BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND QUALITY. "
"246" "LG fan. Had a 12 year old LG that retired to the bedroom. Fantastic picture and features for the price. would highly recommend. there is no TV out there with great sound-that's why everyone makes sound bars.LOL "
"247" "Waited a long time for a 65 inch TV. Worth the wait. The smart features are awesome, color is great....set up easy. The base stand is pretty wide, so it does need a larger TV stand than one with a shorter span...but other than that, LOVE it. "
"248" "Good size, good design, good loaded content, ease to set up. Image could be crispier. Good value for the money. "
"249" "I bought 2 of these TV's for guest bedrooms. I just love the size, which is perfect for each room. Highly recommend this brand and size. Good deal go get it. "
"250" "Love my TV! Good value for the price! "
"251" "High quality shipping, high quality TV, very happy, good product and price "
"252" "TV would be OK if it wasn't for the white light that appears at the top of the screen just below the frame. Extremely irritating. "
"253" "Tv is defective, top of the tv has a few lines that keep on flickering. "
"254" "I bought this tv because of the price. I should have known it was too good to be true. Tv consistently doesn¡¯t recognize HDMI inputs and consistently displays phantom ¡°input¡± pop-ups. I¡¯ve contacted the seller & LG...the sellers return policy is unrealistic & prohibitive. Stay away & get a Samsung. "
"255" "Anither great LG tv for the kitchen area. Replaced a smaller 43\" tv and am happy with the equality and google and alexa voice assistants built in. Great options "
"256" "It was delivered on time, the setup was easy. Great picture quality and sound. Lot of different options for picture quality and sound. Only drawback is with the TV remote, have a Hisense tv nearby and the remote controls both tv's the same with the Hisense remote. Other than that love the tv and picture quality. "
"257" "Had 5 months then little black square appeared and keeps popping up and going away. "
"258" "The TV is light and wall mountable, the picture is good, and the smart features work well. However, the TV is much thicker than I was expecting. The dimensions say 3.5 inches, which seems pretty thick compared to other LED TVs. The name ThinQ is misleading. "
"259" "Had an older LG 47\" flat screen and was for many years happy. Upgraded to this 65\". The TV is great for the day I've had it. Amazon dropped the ball with shipping! "
"260" "Got it yesterday. Set up this AM. the packaging was dynamite. Even UPS could not destroy it. Insructions are somewhat basic. Heck of of a buy for the price. "
"261" "65¡± is pretty damn big for a TV so just make sure you¡¯re measurements are correct for where it¡¯s going. Overall I have no complaints. The set up was fast and simple. "
"262" "Average TV. Very user friendly, and remote is updated from previous versions. "
"263" "the send was fast and free , about the tv is good quality picture and sound not the best but good enough for to watch movies and all you want to look , the only negative thing is the control remote is nothing smart like the tv , and a better control sold separately ,anyway i recommend it "
"264" "Does not have everything it says in the description it says 3 HDMI to USB but only has 2 HDMI and 1 USB got 2 TVs both the same Maybe boxed wrong or the description was put in wrong do not know "
"265" "For the price, this is an incredible deal. However, there are limitations, as you would expect in this price range. First, the physical installation is pretty easy, especially because it's so light for its size - ESPECIALLY compared to the 50\" plasma we are replacing! However, make sure you have your cables plugged into the TV jacks BEFORE you install it on a wall mount; the jacks are impossible to reach once it's on the wall. Second, the logical setup doesn't seem very intuitive. I still can't figure out how to get it to default to HDMI 1 input rather than searching for an over-the-air signal when it turns on. Third, the adjustments you can make in picture quality are very limited; you get a choice of 6 pre-sets that include brightness, contrast, etc., but there is no apparent way to create a custom set of settings. Finally, like most of these 60 mHz larger TVs, the interpolation it does for some video content gives it a pronounced \"soap opera effect\" on some content. (Google that to read more about it.) Still, for the price it is very good quality. "
"266" "First one showed up with a broken screen. was replaced in a week. Second unit is AWESOME!!! Should have gotten the 72\" but love this 65\" . Tons of apps, great color. Very nice!! "
"267" "No problems. I watched a couple of old movies and saw things I missed before. "
"268" "very good quality, easy to install, perfect packaging "
"269" "I used to be loyal to a different brand of tv until I won one of these at my companies employee picnic. When I first used this tv I was blown away, it's quality and picture are amazing.If you want an awesome 4k tv give these a shot and you will be happy! "
"270" "Great TV with sharp picture and sound. Easy setup. "
"271" "After reading a lot of reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this tv, but I'm really glad I did...Arrived on time and totally intact. Easy set up out of the box and works perfectly with my Echo Dot! I have had it over a week and no problems at all! "
"272" "Perfect for my small apartment, clear sound and picture. "
"273" "I wasn't able to stream the football game from CBS, but I was able to stream live TV via Hulu. Flimsy stand legs and directions are pretty sketchy. Picture and sound both good. Good TV for the price. "
"274" " I bought this LG brand because I still have the older one gave it to my brother still works I bought it went Call if duty 2 came out. "
"275" "Great price. LG makes great LED Smart TVs. Picture and sound are absolutely spot on. Thanks. Fred PS. 43\" "
"276" "Tv has great picture. Legs are on the ends of tv so you need long table getting amazon prime app soon "
"277" "Super easy setup with Netflix and prime. Good picture and decent sound for small room. Good picture even at an angle. I wish the remote had backlight since the up down and select all feel similar. "
"278" "Great OS, fast an efficient for watching netflix amazon video and streaming through in-build chromecast. "
"279" "I really don't know about the durability since I've only had this TV for a few weeks but the image quality is astounding! "
"280" "Am now rocking my 4k hd mounted on my wall,remove the 55\" Samsung I had there for a bigger screen am so happy thanks amazon!! "
"281" "Great picture with ARC and optical! We use it in our travel trailer and installed with no problems! "
"282" "I have 2 of these. 1 purchased in 2016 and 1 purchased in 2018. Both give excellent 4K picture and good sound quality. I highly recommend LG TV. "
"283" "No complaints, great tv "
"284" "Nice quality picture and sound. Remote works great. I read about flimsy stand, it is but I planned to wall mount. "
"285" "Bought this as a second TV for a Den. Picture quality is excellent with just a little tweaking. "
"286" "Bedroom! All features applicable, some Aspects have to be Updated due to lack of Use!No Issues! "
"287" "so far very pleased, has much better picture than other tv's out there, especially samsung. one will need a sound bar "
"288" "How can Amazon say this is Alexa certified? The TV as purchased DOES NOT WORK WITH ALEXA. You will have to buy a $60 additional magic remote that is not in stock. "
"289" "The TV screen is shaky! Feels like someone else has returned it before... "
"290" "Was working fine until a vertical strip started to appear on the left side of the screen. It was repaired - but still a cause for concern as I have never needed to have a TV repaired before. Luckily was within the one year warranty. "
"291" "We have always owned LG TVs and have always loved them. This one is very very nice. Very bright and clear picture. "
"292" "Have struggling adjusting brightness. The screen is very dark. The brightness is set to 50% by default. Setting to higher values helps for a while, but not sure if it is memorizing the setting. "
"293" "Still new to me, it is okay so far. Good picture, and sound quality, would buy again. "
"294" "Beautiful tv and easy to use. So many great features and the quality is fantastic. The only thing I¡¯m confused about is a warp in the screen at the top. Is this going to get worse or make any difference in quality or years I get out of it? "
"295" "I love everything about it except the feet it came with, they were so cheap and wobbly I had to buy a separate stand. They shouldn¡¯t have even bothered... "
"296" "Feliz con mi tv. Tuve q comprar una base diferente para acomodarlo en la mesa. "
"297" "Picture quality excellen Nighttime daytime TV not bright enough I¡¯m not recommend this TV on the bright room "
"298" "The replacement TV is perfection... Thank you very much "
"299" "We loved this TV. Great picture quality, easy to set up and use. However there were issues with the picture after a short amount of time. LG has terrible customer service and would not resolve the problem. Amazon has amazing customer service. Amazon helped us get through the problems with the TV they were professional and extremely responsive. "
"300" "This Television met all expectations. Price, Quality, Picture, Sound. Would recommend to anyone. "
"301" "I love this TV but assembly be careful and get help the legs will break if you're not careful. "
"302" "Love this tv. It is perfect size for the space. Everything LG makes is solid "
"303" "Love everything about my new tv <U+0001F4FA>. "
"304" "The TV came damaged - the company offered to fix it, but it would have taken over a week for the parts and then for them to fix it. Not to mention they first said they could fix it in a couple of days - but then called back to say it would take longer. It's frustrating when you buy a new TV and it already needs fixing - returned item with no issue. "
"305" "This is a decent tv. Picture is good and very responsive. Frame rate is decent. If I had any complaint it is that this tv is super plasticky but what do you expect for a sub $300 tv? "
"306" "It¡¯s the biggest screen we¡¯ve ever had. It¡¯s brought my family great delight. "
"307" "Easy to operate. Everything is automatic. 5 stars *****Best TV I ever bought. "
"308" "Picture on this TV is great. I took a star off because of the awkward placement of the feet and the sound quality of the built in speakers is not great. All in all though this TV is an excellent deal for the price "
"309" "Great audio/visual devise. This is my second one. "
"310" "I was disappointed that you advertised that Netflix works on it. I tried so many ways to install Netflix and it won't allow.. so disappointed and misleading advertising.. digusted. "
"311" "Has had screen bleed from the start on the upper edge. Such a hassle to send back, but am not completely happy here. Was expecting a top notch product. "
"312" "These tv's have beautiful color.. Like the brand better than any other tv we have ever had. "
"313" "There is a lag with the picture and sound matching up sometimes. Other times, the sound is so distorted, you can¡¯t understand it and it sounds like the tv is damaged or there¡¯s some sort of interference. Doesn¡¯t seem like the same quality as my old LG tv. Disappointed I¡¯ll be returning it since the picture was good. "
"314" "Really nice TV for the money! Easy setup and the picture quality is NICE!! "
"315" "1 "
"316" "Tv for bedroom - nice price for the size. Includes the Amazon app. Love it. "
"317" "I like it. So far I just use it for watching TV. I¡¯m not very ¡°techie¡± and figured out how to do anything else "
"318" "Good picture, and a good variety of extras, (netflix, you tube, amazon prime, etc. "
"319" "Made it through shipping and works good enough. The HDMI port I use will temporally stop working for some reason, causing me to have to switch to a different port. Til that one stops working then I have to switch back to the first one, and so on and so forth. "
"320" "Set up was very easy, crystal clear picture, very light - I just love it! "
"321" "This TV is amazing the picture clarity in life like picture is just wonderful "
"322" "Easy install. Price could be cheaper. "
"323" "Great TV with built in roku and internet and blue tooth. That¡¯s cool. "
"324" "Es buen Tv pero lo consigues a menor precio en otra lugar "
"325" "Good quality. Not a true 4K but good for the price point. Can¡¯t complain. "
"326" "Bought this as a gift for my mom and they LOVE it!! GREAT picture and easy to use. "
"327" "Great product and works well in our bedroom. Love being able to hook an external hard drive to it and watch movies and such "
"328" "Great looking and easy operation "
"329" "Tv is absolutely amazing. Love the picture quality. Came double boxed but it protected it from being broken in anyway. "
"330" "After a mix up with the first delivery amazon quickly sent a replacement! This tv is amazing! LG all the way "
"331" "Great TV. Arrived promptly, but my husband decided it was too big, so we returned it. "
"332" "The tv functions fine, but part of why I made this purchase was due to the notification on Amazon this device would work with my echo dot. It does not. Even customer support said it wouldn¡¯t directly and I would need an additional remote purchase. I¡¯m trying to buy a smart tv to have less remotes, not more!!! "
"333" "Solid packaging, quality product "
"334" "Remote stopped working, rendering the television useless. There are no directional buttons on the tv, just one you can click - and it doesn't work. Great! "
"335" "Looks amazing and has surprised me with its functionality. It bluetooths to my headphones and speakers. AwesomeThe feet/stand could be a little simpler though. "
"336" "First tv I have ever bought myself. Great picture quality in every aspect of the tv. Connected to my echo easily. "
"337" "Fantastic tv and at a super price. "
"338" "Love the smart feature; Netflix, hulu, Amazon video, etc. Favorite part is google assistant, makes finding everything a lot easier and quicker - very intelligent processor inside. Great for gaming and picture quality is unmatched. Only dislike would be some apps don't work but I may just have to update. "
"339" "Do not buy from day one it had issues. It is still under warranty but LG USA and LG westafrica keep tossing. The screen has gone bad in exactly 2 months "
"340" "Wonderful picture and sound. Hard to set up. "
"341" "It¡¯s d a pain to use. "
"342" "Tv was broke "
"343" "awesome beatiful "
"344" "I bought this TV to watch movies and TV shows on it. So far I have watch movies and TV shows on it. 5 stars! "
"345" "My son is enjoying the TV. Her likes the apps that came with it. "
"346" "Vey nice 4K and inexpensive at all !!!! "
"347" "Awesome tv, no complaints "
"348" "Screen died after 3 days. Replacement sent immediately. Picture quality of the new on already looks better. Will review the new one through its review link. "
"349" "Fue muy buena oferta la mentablemente en mi pais los impuesto son muy alto y tuve que regresarla pero excelente servicio.Me la recivieron y Me regresaron el dinero. "
"350" "bought to replace tv, works great, very happy with it, would buy again and tell a friend "
"351" "This is a 65\" TV I purchased in October and then decided it was a Christmas gift. So, it was not opened until the Saurday after Christmas when I had helpers..that's when it was determined the screen was broken. Now Electronic Express is saying there's nothing that can be done ?! "
"352" "Great "
"353" "For the price, you can¡¯t beat it. Have to figure the picture in order to set it up the way you want it and that can be confusing "
"354" "Love this tv "
"355" "It¡¯s a decent price for a TV this size. With a fire stick, Apple TV and other streaming services, all one really needs is a monitor. This TV was great has Netflix and Hulu and you can add other apps in it as well, if desired. I mainly use it w my fire stick. "
"356" "Love our TV "
"357" "I love this tv. The picture is great. I use it with Apple TV to get the full 4K "
"358" "Great picture quality. "
"359" "I did like everything "
"360" "Lg the best "
"361" "Recommend "
"362" "Love my new TV. I bought the magic remote for it separately and the keyboard and I love all of it! Great picture too! Definitely recommend getting all three together! "
"363" "I got this TV a few days back. It works for 15 minute and then a signal not found message comes and all applications shut down. I went online and it seems a regular problem with LG Tvs. I will call the customer service but my recommendation is stay away from this TV. "
"364" "We are very happy with this TV. Just set it up yesterday 08/03/18 so haven't had much time to use it much. the set up was very easy with on screen guidance and the color and picture clarity superb. connecting the DVD and other services like Netflex Amazon was easy. So far so good. "
"365" "This tv is really god but i recommend putting it on the wall because the stand it comes with is really weak and the Tv will just break them. My only complaint is the smart remote being sold separately for like $50 but other than that the tv is great "
"366" "Arrived with the screen crumpled at the corner. "
"367" "Delivers everything it promised. "
"368" "Brought at the end of July. Both HDMI ports have \"died\" and do not work. I've tried multiple cables with no success. "
"369" "I replaced the 40\" in my livingroom with the 49\". This picture is awsome! The apps are so easy to get to. "
"370" "Picture isn¡¯t as good as my Sony. "
"371" "This is my first smart tv. Great price and great quality. Easy to set up. I got it on time and earlier in the day than I had expected. Was wrapped awesomely which put my mind at ease because it¡¯s one thing I was nervous about.. didn¡¯t want to get a cracked screen! I¡¯d buy LG over a Samsung any day. "
"372" "My second LG TV.....good quality product at a very competitive price point. "
"373" "I love this TV it is terrific except for the flimsy legs. Other than that one of the best TV¡¯s I¡¯ve ever had. "
"374" "I bought three as Christmas gifts for my kids. On opening them on Christmas Day, one of them had a cracked screen and the screws were also not correct because they were different from the others. I would like to return it to be fixed or exchanged. "
"375" "Already had the 43 inch, works great just remember the video is with magic remote. This model does not have it but it seems fairly cheap to buy separate "
"376" "The best TV I had so far I wish I could a got a 65 like I wanted but for some reason this 55 inch lg seems a bit bigger out the box are used it with my Xbox one x and Flawless 4K visual Makes me stuck to my chair "
"377" "I like the Bluetooth features. You can connect a Bluetooth speaker or headphone. You can also connect your phone by Bluetooth and play music and audio from your phone (Spotify, Youtube, etc.) in the TV. "
"378" "When I receive the tv, it¡¯s broken tv. "
"379" "Love this! Looks great! "
"380" "Outstanding TV for the woodshop! "
"381" "very nice "
"382" "Received as expected "
"383" "This was for my son, so I'm just passing on opinions heard from him. He loves this tv, but it was to replace a broken one just out of warranty. Also an LG "
"384" "Apparently these TVs are so fragile that a tiny impact (a dog's tail, a 25 cent rubber ball, etc.) can damage the LED screen. At that point it is not covered by a warranty. Do not buy this piece of junk. "
"385" "Great tv. The picture is clear, the sound is great. "
"386" "Works well "
"387" "Great picture and so easy to set up "
"388" "Awesome Picture and sound........Family loves this TV. Great price and delivery was smooth. "
"389" "Great picture at an unbelievable price. Lots of options. Everybody comments on the picture quality. "
"390" "The stand is not ideal, but the picture quality is good. Getting the screen settings just right is a little tricky. "
"391" "Super 4k picture. Great sound, "
"392" "Great TV! No complaints. "
"393" "Very nice to utilize, great picture, love it. "
"394" "Good tv "
"395" "the color is perfect, the voice command is accurate, the sound is amazing "
"396" "Works as described. "
"397" "Got this for a handicapped friend that lives for tv. His previous VISIO crashed an I hope this lasts for him. "
"398" "Get the 2018 model like I did. This one had light bleeding "
"399" "55\"<U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603> "
"400" "Got this TV for around 370 dollars with tax, and for that price the picture quality can not be beat. Besides the crappy little plastic legs I have no complaints. Setup was quick and easy and 4k/HDR content looks absolutely incredible. "
"401" "I like the name brand and it's a 4k smart TV. I had it for 3 months so far so good. "
"402" "Good TV, good price, good picture. "
"403" "Se ve muy bien "
"404" "I wanted a larger screen and a smarter tv. This LG met all my expectations. "
"405" "Great tv. Layout is odd but you get used to it. "
"406" "Broken pedestal stand please provide 2 replacement stands. Cheap plastic stands that don't seem safe- both had broken locking pieces in the box and cannot safely lock into slots on television. The fact that they are broken renders the tv unusable. TV seems to work fine but cannot be used without functioning pedestal stands. "
"407" "I received this and after setting it up and attempting to turn it on was very disappointed to see the screen was distorted. After looking closer there were several large cracks in the screen. Complete waste of time had to return. "
"408" "Great quality TV, lots of features and great app support and definitely worth the price. "
"409" "Very disappointed to get home just to realize I can put my TV up because it had the wrong screws In the box so now I have to go find and buy the correct screws for the legs "
"410" "Great tv love the picture and all the other functions. A major upgrade from my past tv, love how advanced this tv is "
"411" "if you cranked up setting you lose picture quality "
"412" "Get off the fence TV 466.99 and 4 year warranty 16.97 are a great deal well now the warranty has gone up a littleOrdered Monday Afternoon and had it Yesterday morning. Pennsylvania to Florida in a day and half. I had a LG TV that got taken out by lightning before so Menu was familiar with had to shut down (turn off) the energy saver mode turn up the brightness to 60% and turn on HDR and that's it I couldn't be happier the Web OS works great I have Xfinity with 150 mbs so all apps work well with my internet service. Received double boxed original t.v box in a larger box with air cushions "
"413" "The overall picture is sharp but somewhat dark. I have tried adjusting every setting, but still just does not seem bright enough. Otherwise good tv. "
"414" "Everything is perfect "
"415" "A wonderful TV, with an outstanding picture. Would be 5 stars, but even to use the legs supplied by LG temporarily was not possible as they both cracked during set-up......... "
"416" "Really like the TV. Great picture. Easy to setup and to adjust the Picture. Love it!!!!! "
"417" "5 stars for all. "
"418" "Buen tv pero parece que es refurbished no nuevo. "
"419" "TV arrive with a shattered screen. "
"420" "Great picture, amazingly light weight. The remote is kinda cheap and needs to be pointed accurately to work. A better remote and five stars. "
"421" "Best picture ever had! Plan on buying a second, as soon as wife gives me the ok. Love amazon. "
"422" "I am very annoyed, just wanted to get home and turn on the TV without the remote, apparently it is impoossible! "
"423" "Everything they said it would be. "
"424" "Con mi Xbox x fluye muy bien "
"425" "Great picture. Sound is ok but I bought a sound bar to enhance the sound (which I planned on. No matter what tv I bought) and it¡¯s way better. "
"426" "We had a 24¡± for he longest time because we lived in a really small apartment, but I have extremely poor vision and am partly colorblind so when we moved to a big place the old tv was impossible to watch with it bein more than a foot away. So I was trying to find a 55¡± or bigger tv that wasn¡¯t stupidly expensiveBrowsed around and eventually ran into this one and it¡¯s more than I was expectingThe visual and sound settings are perfect and give me options that are easy on my eyes and the picture looks greatNow I¡¯m not one of those super anal about sound and picture people that goes looking for low priced stuff that sounds like super expensive stuff, but it¡¯s what I personally was afterWe mostly play games on it and everything looks amazing "

"533" "GreatTV "
"534" "Picture is gorgeous and crisp. Very black black, and very bright clean colors. Design is slim and very light weight, and looks very nice on the TV stand. HOWEVER the sound on this TV is just awful. I've had other LED TVs before and nothing was close to this bad. Music blasts out, but the dialogue is totally muffled and lost. You cannot understand a word that comes out of this TV. Constantly find myself adjusting the volume up to 55 for dialogue and then rushing to turn volume down to 15 when any type of music comes on. Up/down/up/down for every TV show. Shockingly bad, yes, its THAT bad....Solution is to buy a soundbar, and turn off TV speakers. Now I am happy again.... "

"546" "Best tv ever "
"547" "The portable size "
"548" "like everything "
"549" "best good "
"550" "Works great "
"551" "So far so good. Easy set up including the easy on screen programming. Picture and sound is wonderful. The shipping packaging was really excellent. TV arrived on time and in perfect condition. The price was also a great value. "
"552" "A good TV, fairly simple to set up. However I bought this for the Alexa connectivity and it seems to still be almost in beta. Half of the commands do not work. And was a huge pain to try to juggle all the apps to get it to work in the first place. Still considering if I should return it.After a while I have learned how to use it better. However this sentence pretty much sums the whole experience up. You can turn the TV off with Alexa but you cannot turn it on with it. "
"553" "I purchased the TV because it is alexa certified and showed it would work with our Echo Dot. After getting off the phone with LG the only way to use the echo dot with the tv is to buy their $50 Magic Remote to unlock the ability. How is this Amazon Alexa certified? There is no reason that I should need a special remote to use Alexa with the TV when it shows the Dot is good enough. "
"554" "Recieved tv, put on wall turned on and two round white circles top center of tv, do discussed. Not ordering another .Shopping at local store instead. "
"555" "This is used in our basement for family entertainment. Don¡¯t like tat there is no owners manual that illustrates setup. Every thing is done on the tv without written instructions. Not being tech savvy, I don¡¯t know what all the initials stand for and what will happen with different options activated. "
"556" "The screen was broken on arrival. I think the problem is that the screen has no protection to soften impacts while being transported. "
"557" "I had to squeeze this 43\" into a 36\" space in a wall unit, so I had to saw off the front part of one of the legs.It fits, albeit at an angle.Satisfied overall, but my other TV, a 40\" Samsung, actually has a sharper picture, even connected to a long DirectTV cable, which displays at 720p, while the LG receives a 1080p signal.Odd "
"558" "Picture quality is superb for the price. The functions available are manly and well worth the purchase. For the money, it will be hard to beat. "
"559" "Came with issues with the screen and there are two spots as well as issues with the screen quality "
"560" "Don¡¯t buy! "
"561" "Tv was broke straight out of the box and this was a gift<U+0001F629>so embarrassing!! "
"562" "Great product and great seller. Thanks "
"563" "Very disappointed in the picture quality and clarity.I spent hours using most of the included adjustments trying to achieve a crisp and sharp picture, without any luck.We replaced our 60 inch Samsung with the LG UHD 65 inch, and unfortunately this 2018 TV is sub par at best. "
"564" "I don't like how all of the movies look like soap operas. Poor picture quality. "
"565" "First one showed up with a broken screen, return process was easy and they quickly replaced it. Tv arrived and I was really excited to watch a UHD movie on it, everything was just very dark. Contrast is terrible. I've gone through the video settings and everything is almost too dark to watch. The display is super dim so it's almost like you're not even getting any of the 4K details. I'll probably be putting my 5 year old 55\" Samsung back out in the living room.Positives:LightweightCheapThin perimeterEasy to connect my surround soundSmart functions work wellNegatives:Not bright enough to seeFirst came with a broken screen "
"566" "Una de las mejores compras, lo unico malo es que no viene con un control remoto moderno (magico)...pero va bien la tv. "
"567" "Great picture but setting up was bi\ of a challenge. . I used the verbal assist while setting up which was awful. She sounded like a robot on steroids. Spoke 3 times faster than a normal human. Reminded me of those radio commercials where some legal stuff must be disclosed. where the announcer speaks fast at the end of the commercial. Awful! I finally figured out how to shut her up.I do wish that a manual had been included. The TV does so much but I will probably miss a lot. The least they can do is put a link to a PDF manual "
"568" "I did my homework before buying (2) new 4K 43\" TV's. LG had impressive reviews and for the money seemed like the best option! So I bought 2 of them in July 2018. My life has been a nightmare of revolving around appointments ever since! The problems began the day after the install. I bought the 2 43UK6300 TV and sound bars and had a company install them. I am in a wheelchair and could not do the wall mount installs of the TV's and sound bars. Thankfully I did buy extended coverage on the TV's only, but sadly not on the soundbars... But I will get to that. The day after the install, the living room tv remote would not turn on the sound bar. I had to manually turn it on. I tested things and found that if the tv was off more than 20 minutes, the sound bar would not turn back on again and you had to manually turn it back on. Install company came back and reprogrammed and thought they had it fixed only to have it fail after 20 minutes (yes of course they had left by then). Install company highly recommended I work with Direct TV and get my cable equipment upgraded for the 4K TV's. I spent over 40 hours during the next 2 months getting the cable tv upgraded which was NOT LG fault in any way, just icing on the cake for the LG nightmare that unfolded. Within a few days the tv in the bedroom began to intermittenally fail now. The bottom 1/3 of the screen would flicker on turning on the tv and sometimes present an error message about defective HDMI cables. Sometimes the tv would just turn off after that. Other times after a few minutes, it was almost like a joke and it would clear it self and let me watch tv and yet other timese it would turn on with no issues! The install guys blamed the cable company. The cable company kept coming out and replacing things and checking signals and finally they got frustrated and said there was nothing wrong with their equipment and it was defective tv and sound bars. I called the install company back and they were sure it wasn't the fault of the tv equipment and told me to call the store and to their main office. When I did so, wanting resolution the store blew me off and said it had been too long as it was not Oct 2018 to return the items. I got hot and told him I wold find a lawyer as I was not paying for equipment that would not work consistantly. The store manager said he was hanging up as I mentioned the word lawyer and that was above his pay grade and told me basically it sucked to be me, but I had bought this equipment, waited to long to file complaints and I was just going to have to work with the system to see if they can be repaired!!! I was very angry as I started calling and reporting the issues the very next day on 8/9/18 and have over 20 calls logged between myself and the support team about this over the last 2 months and he kept saying I did not have any record of any of this! I have had over 20 visits from both install team and cable company support trying to fix things when it is the equipment that is defective. I was also told I had to contact LG directly about the sound bar portion as that did not have extended coverage and so I called them as well and they told me that there was no one in a 1000 mile radius to service my equipment! Honestly I do NOT live on the moon. I live an hour away from Seattle WA and thy are trying to tell me that no one in WA, OR, ID, MT, NV, and California could repair my tv! and that they gave me a ticket number and promised to call back in 3-5 days. Well that was 10 days ago so guess they got lost! Back to the install guys who were back again today. They tore apart both tv's and replaced the main boards in both tv's in high hopes that would fix them. So after they spent their 3 hours here today (it was supposed to be a 45 minute visit) they had to give up and call their higher boses who in turn called the store bosses who didn't want to talk to me and they have collectively decided I can bring back at least the tv and exchang them for same of buy different and start the process all over again. Don't know the fate of the sound bars... Here is what went wrong. Almost all intermitten errors BUT errors everysingle repair person saw and sometimes videotaped. 1. Sound Bar in Living room always fails after it has been off for 20 min or more. 2. If sound bar in either room has been on for over 1.5-2 hours and it decides that is enough, the sound bar shuts off and you have to read lips or shut everything down and start again which makes the sound come back. 3. Both tv's are now doing the screen flutter when being turned on intermittenly and flashing hdmi cable errors, Sometimes tvs just shut off afterwards and other times it is a joke and they clear the error and move on. The cables have all been replaced multiple times and currently have very expensive top of the line ($100 cable) in there now.And still the error occurs. A couple days ago the 1/3 screen flicker increased to 3/4 screen flicker in the bedroom now. So I hav been reading all the customer comments/reviews on 43\" 4K Smart TV's for the last several hours as I will be heading out tomorrow to get this stupid defective tv's replaced! I will NOT get anymore LG. I am seriously looking at Samsung Or Sony. Both have mixed reviews so not sure shich direction to go. Samsung is about $200 less than Sony but the negative reviews have them neck and neck. So will talk to the manager tomorrow and hope for clarity! This nighmare of having my life revolve around tv support guys just needs to stop!!! The thing that concerns me as I read the reviews on Sony/Samsung they seem to also have some intermittent filures and no one seems to be able to resolve without them having to return the items and hope for the best! I just want to record my shows from cable and watch them when I can. Really simple! I don't game, I don't need all the apps or other services like hulu. I don't do movie channels, just rent one when I want one. So my use is simple but I want a good system to enjoy them on. Don't think this is asking too much, for reliable TV. I live alone and enjoy my interaction with the TV in the evening which has been all hosed up for over 2 months now. So I am done rambling about a miserable experience with LG that I will NEVER repeat! Hopefully by my venting maybe it might warn others ahead of time or give them a clue when it starts happening to them so they don't invest all the time I did for resolution. BUT if anyone heads down this nightmare path, keep a good journal with detailed notes as that is the one factor that is going to help facilitate me getting a proper exchange. Service techs saw how I was recording everything on pages and pages, the call log on the phone, etc. and took copies of everything and that is a big part of what motivated the higher up bosses to agree to allow me to come back to the store to return this stuff and make a new selection. Done rambling. Hope you have better success, just avoid LG! "
"569" "I went into Best Buy to see a hands on comparison between the TV's. I am a Samsung fan, bought a 55 through Amazon and still love it. Then I bought a 46. Both of them had power supplies that failed and I had to replace.I also bought two 40 inch Samsung's as well as a 32 and none of those had any problems.I was put back by all of the bad reviews pertaining to reliability on the Samsungs, so I looked up TV's in Consumer Reports. Their top 3 TV's in all of the ratings were LG's.That is when I went into Best Buy to see for myself. I toured the floors and the walls looking for a WOW moment, and I came around a corner, and there she was; Wow is an understatement. I instantly knew this was the one for me. I went and got a salesman and wanted to know if they had one in stock in an unopened perfect box. They sure did. As soon as he came over the words came right out of his mouth that I saw in person reviewing the other sets, he said, \"This is the nicest TV in the store under a thousand dollars\". I couldn't agree with him more. The picture quality was so outstanding it blew my mind.Let's understand something. Next to an OLED TV they all pare in comparison so if you are in the minimally $1500 plus price club that is where you should be looking.Okay so I buy one with the perfect box, take it home and plug it in. Wow what a dull dark picture. I couldn't believe it was the same set I saw in the store. It was going back. (I always keep the box and wrappings for at least the first week.)Then I discovered the VIVID setting. Wowza, bingo that was it. It must be the way the settings were in Best Buy. This picture went from dull and lifeless to unbelievable. It's my first 4k TV, but even the OTA Over The Airwaves rabbit ear antenna shows were mind boggling.So I go into Costco and they have one on display next to all of the others, and I ask the salesman for a remote, and he went and got me one. I changed the picture setting to VIVID and bingo, the salesman is blown away. He says it looks better than the more expensive set right along side of it. Then the young hot shot who used to work at Best Buy came over and wanted to change the setting back. He said he wanted the settings to be standard. The only problem was the setting the store was using wasn't standard; when I went in to change it, it was set to \"User Settings\", so they purposely were dumbing it down to make sales of more expensive sets.Anyhow, you decide for yourself. Go into a store, and change the picture setting to VIVID, and you tell me which set you want. Amazon is even beating the Costco price by only a few dollars, but it is the cheapest I have seen this set.Oh yeah the Magic Remote is not included, and has all of the bells and whistles. I got one on eBay for $35 brand new.Fabulous TV for a crazy cheap amount of money. Highly recommended. "
"570" "Bought this to replace a Samsung TV that died on me. Had never purchased an LG before but likedwhat I read in the reviews. (a big advantage with Amazon). I knew ahead of time that the supportlegs on this were a poor design so I bought a support stand for it.(https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KW560AG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)I am very happy with the TV and think the picture on it is wonderful. You may have to play with the settings to get it the wayyou want it but that is true with any TV. I used most of the settings recommended by Consumer Reports. For built in speakersthe sound is very good.I attached my Amazon Fire TV box to it and it works perfectly. I have no intention of using the built in Apps on the TVas I have read too much negative about them and do not like the tracking and privacy issues that comes with using them.Got the TV at a very good price and am a very happy customer. Thanks again Amazon. "
"571" "Problem with the legs attached to the tv. They snapped (both of them) under the weight of the tv. Yes, the super thin, super light weight tv. Also, about a month in to owning it HDMI port #1 just stopped working. Was working one day, next day - nope! Picture is good, but this rate it¡¯ll fall apart by Christmas. First LG tv I¡¯ve owned, not going well so far. "
"572" "Screen was broken when package opened "
"573" "The TV works (49\" version). The legs are horrible. I don't like the design, placement, attachment method, or height of the legs.Placement: 41.5\" apart from each other. means you need a huge table to hold the TV. This is the smallest TV I have had since buying my first TV after moving out of my parents place in 2006. 5 TVs, smallest one... needs the largest table. The placement of the legs is due to the speakers placement underneath the TV.Attachment: The legs are a two piece mounting, a twist and lock to kind of align them for putting in the screws (which you have to use if you are using the feet, or the feet fall out under the weight of the TV... which is very light).Design: I would have looked at wall mounting, but the placement of the speakers in the bottom of the TV would make for bad sound from the TV without an external speaker system.Height of the legs: as with the design there is not enough gap to allow the speakers to work well.Overall, definitely the least I have spent on a TV since 2006... and for good reason. If money is the motivator, in this case, don't expect anything more than you pay for. "
"574" "It's a nice TV with great picture. However, it broke within 3 months of having it and now it's been 2 weeks and LG is saying the part is on backorder so I have to wait even longer. They said within 30 days they will know if they can send me a new one or will send a tech to repair it. So I could be without my TV for 47 days.Update: Still have not received a new TV after 5 weeks. After being on the phone with customer service multiple times they said they can't send a replacement. I was told I would be getting a phone call within 72 hours. No phone call so I had to call them. They finally said they don't have one to send so now I have to wait another 4 to 5 weeks to get a check in the mail for the amount of the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS TV OR ANY LG PRODUCTS!! "
"575" "The WiFi stopped working after a month and made several calls to LG customer service. They put you on hold literally for 2 hours and after you finally get through you have talk to someone offshore and that person is no help, nothing finally gets done.Junk TV and horrible customer service "
"576" "At 5-1/2 months, horizontal & vertical lines showed up on the screen. I contacted LG for a warranty repair, and instead of pointing me towards a LG certified repair shop 20 minutes away...LG assigned it to a shop TWO hours away that refused the repair. Then they assigned it to another shop (also 2 hours away) that never returned my calls. Then finally assigned it to the local shop. Then for some reason, LG closed the ticket, saying \"Repair Completed\" (shop hadn't even seen the tv yet).Since it was getting close to the end of the warranty period, I decided to buy 'LG Premium Care' extended warranty...WHAT A WASTE OF $$$! I finally heard back from LG in early Dec, saying that the tv was 'out of warranty' (well duh!?). I had to remind them that 1) I had summited the repair ticket well within the warranty period, and 2) I had the LG Premium Care. So they finally got someone to come out just before Christmas, he verified the problem...said the display panel would need to be replaced.Jump to today, after dealing with 7 months of stonewalling, LG's 'repair' solution? Offer to pay me $640, and I dispose of the tv! NO repair, NO exchange, offer me $400 less than what I paid for the tv...not to mention the money I spent on the extended warranty! Fact is, I bought the tv on Black Friday...so actually paid less than the standard retail which means I'll have to come up with almost $600 to get a comparable replacement!I used to love LG, but I've since found out this is a common issue with their tv's. That, and the fact that they won't back up their product has soured me forever. So buy a LG tv at your own risk (their repair network is a joke), and DO NOT waste your money on their \"LG Premium Care\". "
"577" "This is getting 4 stars because the picture is beautiful. If not so, it would rate lower.It sure would have been nice if ANY of the materials said it needed a 300 x 300 VESA hole pattern for mounting. Or that getting a name brand 300 x 300 mounting plate would not work because of the bolt sizes needed. Regardless, my big issue is sound. I buy a 4k 65\" TV and would like it to sounds good. EVERY other TV I've bought has analog outputs. Many of those with really high end audio use analog because it just sounds better. But there is no way to get audio from this to a very high end audio system (it's old but sounds marvelous) without buying another device to convert optical audio to standard analog audio. "
"578" "I bought the 43. I had purchased a different 43 from Amazon and immediately sent it back because the screen was fuzzy. This is sharp, clear, and works great. I connect it to the internet with an ethernet cable, and it allows selections to Prime, YouTube, browser, or cable and broadcast at startup. It is a similar interface to Samsung. A great TV. "
"579" "Picture quality is nice enough, but this model couldn't possibly work for me the way I have my entertainment set up. I don't have cable or live TV of any kind, haven't for years and won't. I do subscribe to several streaming services, and already use google extensively with google home+mini. So I thought this TV with Google Assistant support and built-in Chromecast would be seamless, right? Nope.The biggest bummer is that whenever you turn it on, it'll prioritize live tv as an input and start off with a noisy snowy screen. This is just heinous. I called LG support and they showed me how to trick the TV into prioritizing HDMI, but then it's just another blank screen, albeit silent and black. The menus are really frustrating to tool around in, and you constantly have to click thru the whole tree to finish adjustments.Assistant and Chromecast support are really iffy and I'm not sure I understand how they can market this as being integrated, maybe 'Assistant-ready'... The TV will make you download a special app and create LG accounts (why?!?) and at the end of it all the TV isn't available in my Google 'Home' network as a fully-featured device. I have to give really specific prompts, which often fail. I can't 'cast' to the TV from my phone photos or apps at all<U+2014>this is a basic Chromecast capability. Again, I called LG support. They told me that for those features to work I would need to buy the LG 'Magic Remote.' What?I picked up another brand and it was a breeze to set up with google and it launches right into my Chromecast when I turn on, or a nice home environment with apps. I was honestly so happy the LG TV wasn't the reality I'd have to live with.So, if you watch mostly live TV this set is probably great, but if you're stringing together services looking to create some ease-of-use you should probably dig into the specs and ask some really specific questions before buying. "
"580" "I like a lot about this LG. I did a lot of research before buying this set and only needed a 43 inch. I wanted a 4K, so this seemed the way to go. Set up is very easy and user-friendly. However, I quickly switched off the voice assistant, which quickly became very annoying. You can switch it off under Accessibility settings. I also found the picture was way too dark and I tried taking brightness all the way up and still it was too dark. Thanks to another review comment, I found that under settings, I could switch off the power saving setting which was set to default. Once I did, the pictured popped to the brightness it should be. I do find there seems to be a trend towards an almost amber effect in the picture almost making it look like everyone has a tan. Annoying. I did find though that if you get into settings and adjust the picture settings, you can make a great improvement in the color, crispness, etc. of the picture. I do not think the default settings really show the best image on this set and I surprised that LG set them as it did. I purchased this set to replace a very high-end Sony that I had. The Sony was the best top of the line 43 inch smart TV I could find for Sony (and was not cheap). The picture was beautiful for a 1080P and had a white enhancement feature that made the picture gorgeous. Prettier than any other sets I compared it to. I had always had good luck with Sony in the past. However, at barely over 4 years old, I started getting colored lines running across the screen and suddenly the picture went to all yellow and green with triple images. Totally inexcusable, especially considering the price of the TV. I have decided NOT to go back to the purchase of another SONY ... plus they had little to no interest in customer support when I contacted them. Needless to say, I have lost faith in Sony. I suddenly have found I have an LG home. I have LG BluRays, TVs, and my wife's caveman flip phone is even an LG and it is tough as nails. At this point, I am a total LG fan, although, I do think the picture for a 4K TV could be a little better for this particular set. "
"581" "The tv arrived with a large crack and damaged area in the lower right hand part of the screen. When I went online to try to do a replacement, I couldn't request a replacement OR a refund. "
"582" "This is NOT compatible with the LG Magic Remote (contrary to what this product page repeatedly says). I bought a Magic Remote (because they were too cheap to include one), and when the TV detects it, a message pops up saying \"registering new remote\" followed by \"this remote is not compatible with this TV\". I contacted support but they have not been helpful. "
"583" "My parents just bought this TV last week and I helped set it up for them. The TV is very light and the cabinet is thin. The image with normal HD broadcasts is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. I did notice that from my viewing area, which was off to the left of the screen a bit, the image tends to darken a bit the farther you move away from being centered on the screen. This does not happen with my Panasonic plasma TV at home. It's not a big deal for them since both of their sitting positions are pretty much right in front of the TV.I opened the YouTube app and had to update it which took less than a minute. Once that was done the app was launched and I searched YouTube for \"4k content\" and had a pretty good selection of videos to choose from. The first few were nature scenes and the images were incredible. We then searched for \"4k Europe scenes\" and found a bunch of travel videos showcasing interesting places in Germany, Switzerland and France. Again, the image was excellent we were amazed at the clarity and colors.Like others have mentioned, the sound is not all that good as the tiny speakers appear to point down from the base of the cabinet. Best to get a sound bar or a separate sound system for this TV. All in all the picture is amazing with 4k content but just average with regular HD. "
"584" "Have had TV a couple of weeks replacing a seven year old 47\" Flat Screen. The picture is much darker than the Samsung with shadows between areas but the pluses outweigh the negatives with this TV. Once you dial in this product it is a great value if you get it for the right price. Viewing angle is great interface is easy to use along with setup. No problems with internet. Love the magic remote (purchase separate) it has a curser like a mouse that you can use on the web. I went to the LG website to check on picture settings and found a chart on what settings in what light and it made a huge difference . Owners manual is a joke like most products these days. I would recommend it "
"585" "I bought mine at a local Costco warehouse store. I ended up returning it due to a number of picture quality issues. The first issue was a light leak along the bottom bezel. It was especially noticeable with letter boxed content. The second issue was banding caused by the local dimming feature. On occasion the banding occurred even with the local dimming feature disabled.It's possible I got a dud, but from what I can tell, the banding issue is a real issue specific to this model. I returned the TV and bought a different brand.On the plus side, this LG TV has an excellent UI. "
"586" "I purchased this tv because I wanted to upgrade to 4k tv for my ps4 pro and I not happy... I mainly use it for gaming and the hdr picture is horrible even trying to adjust the picture it¡¯s still not good. I¡¯m passing it on to my son and just gonna stick with Sony which never disappoints. "
"587" "Really outstanding picture for the price, we bought the 65 inch at Wally World. It fit (just barely) in my Honda CRV in the box. My advice is to get the largest screen you can fit in both your living room and your car. You generally wish you had gone bigger, but if you cannot fit it in your car it is a real pain. You want something you can take home and, if there is an issue, bring back to the store in your car.Like all TVs, you have to tweak the picture settings to really get it to shine.First, turn off all power saving functions. All TV makers have power saver features to give them a great Energy Star rating, but you would never want to sacrifice the picture quality for the tiny energy use reduction.I think the \"HDR Effect\" picture mode is the best. This will help video that is not HDR look a little more like it was HDR (and will not affect true HDR video).I think Super Resolution is really great. When you are viewing material that is less than full 4K (which is almost everything you are watching) it will upscale it to 4K very well. Instead of just multiplying pixels to fill the screen, it calculates intermediary colors between pixels. The effect is dramatic, crank it to high.Enable ULTRAHD Deep Color.All noise reduction should be turned off.Other than that, adjust the basic settings (brightness, contrast, etc).Note that each input (HDMI 1, 2, etc) as well as the on-board apps (e.g. Netflix) must be set individually. "
"588" "Easy to set up. But not sure I am getting the 4K resolution. My TV picture shows 480p only. What could be the problems ? anyone can help? "
"589" "I got this for a Christmas present and the picture and sound are good but the streaming set up is very poor. The television came only with basic instructions no manual included for streaming set up. I know how to set it up myself but had no luck with it. It works fine for cable or Dish set up. I found out my equipment has to be replaced to make it stream programs and would cost me $200.00 to upgrade everything. The set up is not plug and play and needs to be improved because its in the pioneer stage right now. They make it tough to set up and mine came with no instructions and that's very poor for LG Televisions! I don't like this television because of all the expense and hassle to hook it up! "
"590" "I really wanted to like this TV. The menu and UI are really strong. The picture is decent, but takes a very long time to figure out how to set it up correctly (lose the soap-opera effect).The main problem, which makes the TV nearly un-usable, is the audio output. The speakers are actually pretty good compared to most TVs I've had recently. However, I almost exclusively need to watch with headphones. Trying to connect via bluetooth is almost always a waste. In 80% of movies watched over usb and 30% of online content, the sync between the video and audio is terrible. It is like watching 1950s Godzilla. I researched for days -- there is no resolution that works. I tried to go direct with the headphones, but there is *no 3.5mm headphone jack*, so no way to connect even old-school.I ended up buying a couple of devices, an HDMI to analogue and an optical to analogue device (why do I need to buy more for a tv - should have a simple 3.5mm jack!). Both of these solve most of the audio issues, but sync issues remain for about 15% of all usb content and about 5% of all online content. Further, when using the HDMI device, the TV will not allow a user to change output - if I want to use the speakers or a surround system via optical, I must physically unplug the HDMI. This may be improved by software, but currently is broken.It would be really beneficial if the LG 'store' would include a better video player to download like VLC -- this would solve some of the issues.Just a warning if you are looking at this TV or really most LG 4k TVs. Do a search for lip sync issues if you plan to use it the way i do. "
"591" "55UK6090PUA, I got the 55 inch. This is a very impressive TV, quite nice in a lot of ways. The picture is certainly terrific, and overall it seems loaded with features. However.... Smart TV functionality is of course dependent on a wifi connection, and out of the box the TV wont acquire and hold a household wifi signal without a combination of advanced software configuration setting changes that includes timezone / set manual time, disable quickstart, and set dns to address 8.8.8.8... This is a commonly, even perhaps almost universally, encountered problem for buyers of this TV in the US who wish to connect to wifi. And it's usually impossible for the average user to make these changes without the assistance of support. This is an absurdity, a software problem that shouldn't be present, and I am moved to rate the TV a 1 under the circumstances when it perhaps deserves better. You won't of course encounter this difficulty hooked to regular cable or with say a supplemental Roku unit or Xbox hooked on to grab the signal. "
"592" "I think the picture is great but unlike the 40\" Samsung it replaced, the screen darkens as the viewer moves sideways from a direct \"head on\" view. Some seating in my room is perhaps at a 30 degree angle from viewing directly in front of the screen and the screen darkens noticeably.A second issue is that I wanted to connect some legacy equipment (DVD & VCR) to this TV. Before purchasing it, I viewed the connections online (attached picture). The picture seems to show that there are both \"AV in\" and \"Component in\" inputs which would allow me to connect both my VCR and DVD player. When I received the TV, I realized that the diagram illustrates 2 different ways to connect to a single set of inputs on the TV. So I can only connect one or the other. This wouldn't be an issue for most folks but be advised that only one RCA-type cable connection is possible. This should have been noted on the diagram. "
"593" "At times this set has amazing colors and clarity and other times its like an $8 thriftshop TV. My primary issue was that is had some orange or yellows hues on the faces of actors in shows. It was like a blurred or pixelated appearance on the face in an odd colored hue. It may be from up or down convert I don't know. I tried various settings and it really didn't make a difference. The set does not stand alone on this issue. I noticed other manufacturers have similar issues in the store. Older shows were very blurry to the point you had a hard time recognizing the actors. "
"594" "I love my tv!! One of the best purchases that I have made!! Total worth the money!! "
"595" "I was excited for a new television and better picture quality. I suppose the cracks are designed well... "
"596" "I will never purchase another LG TV! Research this common problem.... We had ours less than 2 years before it failed. Warranty was only 1 year. Our AC went out for a couple days and most of the back light covers fell off inside leaving bright spots all over the screen. None of our other TVs have ever done this and outlasted this one by many years! "
"597" "complete and utter piece of garbage. the wifi was nearly impossible to connect. literally had to change multiple settings on my router to get it to even connect. then the wifi quit working after about 2 weeks. finally i gave up and installed a new ethernet line for my tv and now that doesnt even work. tried resetting tv, unplugging internet, unplugging tv. i know the hub is getting internet because this computer is connected to it. total piece of garbage tv. stuck on connecting for days now. dont waste your money. i wasted $550 "
"598" "I bought this tv (49\") for my 7yr olds new bedroom make over. I love how you can adjust how the sound comes out. It is the loudest tv I've bought in the house. No need for a sound bar or surround. You can adjust the brightness to your liking as well. Make sure to go through all the options and turn off the energy saver for better quality picture and sound! The feet are very stable but I can see where some had issues. The feet lock into place and have 2 screws...one screw hole is difficult to find but trust me there are 2 and it will secure tight. Beautiful picture for both movies and gaming. I will most likely get another one for this awesome price. "
"599" "It¡¯s funny how a TV ¡°Certified for Alexa¡± doesn¡¯t actually work with Alexa. As of 11/24/18, with all firmware updates to the TV, Dot, Fire Stick 4K, it does not work properly with Alexa, which was the entire point of buying a TV ¡°certified¡± to work with Alexa. "
"600" "For the life of me I could not calibrate this TV to have the proper picture. I went through many methods and used the professional THX screen calibration app. I spend a full day performing tweeks to no avail.I even got LG support on the line and they were not helpful in the slightest and opted for me to reset to factory settings. I did not want to do this because putting in your streaming service accounts is a huge pain and it seemed like a waste of time.It turns out this TV is simply not capable of proper color. This TV features RGBW LEDs vs the standard RGB LEDs. After much research, this LED setup cannot produce proper yellows or reds. Yellows look mustard, Reds look maroon. It just isn't capable of producing the right color no matter what you do.How can LG get away with shipping a panel like this?I really like the operating system on LG TvsThe input lag is spectacular on this TV but I ended up returning it and getting the Samsung NU7100 which is very comparable except it has the RGB LEDs. I am so happy I did.With the new TV the colors are true and yellows and reds look... yellow and red. Not to mention the added bonus of Steam Link.Stay away from the LG UK6300 if you are capable of seeing colors. "
"601" "Bought it plugged it in went thru the setup 10min later picture went out sound works back light works. Wasted a bunch of time trying to troubleshoot it. Things I noticed is it is as cheaply made as possible ports don¡¯t line up wit the plastic. Power button slips around etc. "
"602" "This TV is amazing just be very careful with the screen it's very fragile. I like how the TV automatically detects what I using for example if I turn on the PS4 it will change it's video and sound settings to whatever it thinks is the best settings. The only down side of this TV is the phone app the LG TV plus app sucks. I am using a 3rd party app that is much better "
"603" "Picture quality was adequate [once we figured out how to change settings to make the display brighter], but Samsung and Sony are better. Setup was painful [would not work with spectrum cable box] and the description of the remote in the downloadable 'manual' was pathetically incomplete WIFI streaming worked OK. In addition, the one we bought [not on amazon] had a fried system board [according to the LG tech] so only 1 HDMI port was working. Fortunately we were able to return it for full credit. "
"604" "Never againBought 43 UK 6300 feb 18 2019 at Best Buy Never bought LG before and never will again! By March, every few days the TV would \"white out\" basically go all white with some slight picture being seen with normal sound. This happened for like an hour and one time for a day and then went back to normal. I had never never in buying TVs had any such a thing happen within 2-3 of buying it. I never knew when this glitch would occur again. I called LG support and after sending information 2-3 times did I finally get repair person to come and pick up the TV for repair as it is under warranty. He said TV will be ready in 2 weeks and now going on 3 weeks and not have not heard back. This is unacceptable! I am hoping to get a TV that might finally work for at least a year if I am lucky. But after this will never ever buy an LG. I should have stuck with Samsung.Email cliffiebaby@yahoo.comBottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend "
"605" "So far I have ordered this 55\" tv twice now and both times I have received it cracked. there's obviously no reason to turn it on when you can see it's broken and doing so will probably make me more furious. The first 3 pics was the first time ordering and the screen is folded inward the next 5 was the second order. The box has little - no protection at all, it keeps coming in with 100% no discretion so everyone knows exactly what it is and has potential to be stolen off my door step. The box is beat up and a hole on the side with a clear shot to the tv itself about 3inches of space and nothing to block potential impact. I have bought TVs from Walmart that has way more protect in the box than this thing has. I want this tv so badly that I'm willing to try it a 3rd time and customer service has been really nice so far but If this tv continues to come in again I'm demanding complete satisfaction on the matter and escalating it beyond the top.*other customers, buy at your own risk there is a 85% chance you'll receive broken* "
"606" "I had mine for 1 1/2 yrs. Then.... bam. Screen flashes off and on.... what a waste of money! So disappointed in LG. I thought theyre the best... NOT!!!!! "
"607" "Bought this TV yesterday to watch Game of Thrones on. Really disappointed to find out this TV isn¡¯t compatible with any of the HBO apps. I searched far and wide for the app in the provided LG App Store, and found nothing. Though it does have Netflix, Hulu, and amazon prime. I¡¯d have to purchase Amazon Prime in order to watch it directly through the smart tv. Also searched for Pandora, another app i use frequently, and this was not available either. I¡¯m shocked that these 2 very popular apps are not available on this TV, as i have seen them on every other smart TV I¡¯ve ever owned. Luckily i had an old Chromecast laying around and can use it to cast onto the LG TV, but this should not be necessary after spending hundreds $$$ on a brand new smart TV. Also the picture quality settings are very generic, can¡¯t seem to find any options where you can manually adjust brightness, contrast, etc. Will probably return. "
"608" "The box for the LG TV came with no screws to connect the base stand to the TV. LG Support acted as though I was asking for wall mount screws which obviously should not be included. They eventually said they would need a few days to process the request and that they would then ship to me the 2 screws that should have been in the box in roughly 7-10 business days. Now I have a brand new TV still sitting in it's box. Things like this can happen but LG Support should be helpful not act like I am looking for hand outs. "
"609" "television worked fine until it just stopped Amazon contacted LG they tried to fix it nothing so option is to ship it back or take credit for the item. I Opted for the credit would cost too much to return it. very Disappointed in the product "
"610" "Great quality but the legs are surprisingly flimsy. Don¡¯t forget to use the screws to attach them!! And I added the LG sound bar which made a use difference in terms of sound. "
"611" "works great. had to tune the picture, update firmware and then purchase the Magic Remote. Google Assistant was not easy to setup, but once done works well. so far so good. "
"612" "This tv we bought at best buy. It has two large black patches on the screen. Not only best buy wont exchange blaming us for it, local LG tech wont even come out because LG owes him money. What a shame for such a big company. LG - large Garbage "
"613" "THe wifi gave out on this in about 4 months and LG refused to fix it or admit there was a problem. NEVER BUY LG "
"614" "Amazing picture and features for the price! Only drawback is the flimsy feeling legs, but that can easily be remedied with a universal tv stand. Setup is a piece of cake and interface is very user-friendly. Overall, great buy!!! "
"615" "This TV is horrible. It constantly loses Wi-Fi connection, or when it does connect the internet is too slow to watch anything. None of my other devices has any problem whatsoever maintaining connection. "
"616" "the unit seems OK, everything worked, but picture is not as sharp as expected on some media, meaning that depending on the source (cable, 4k, wifi, cloud, dvr, etc) the differences in signal, picture and sound quality are very noticeable. the main thing for me though is that i found the same tv for almost $150 less somewhere else a few weeks after receiving it. "
"617" "DO NOT BUY. This TV is extremely flimsy, tons of people received cracked screens including myself. Just feeling the TV you can tell just about anything will break it. LG is absolutely NO help, nothing is covered in their warranty, they just throw their hands up & tell you you¡¯re a**ed out. "
"618" "I purchased this item new in November of 2017, and a year a one month later the screen started flicker off and off. Time to purchase another television... Definitely not going the LG this time around! "
"619" "What a scam! The description talks all about the voice control and the smart features which integrate this TV with other household devices. But none of that will work unless you have the LG Magic Remote. Which, you will come to find out, does not come with this TV. So once you unbox it you'll have to order the remote that it needs for another $80 to $100. "
"620" "After 2 years the tv started flickering and was unable to use it, or will cost 200 to fix it so it will be better just to buy a new one... "
"621" "I love it. Great sound and picture. Excellent purchase!!!! I RECOMEND. Thank you amazon!!! "
"622" "Pretty light weight. Be prepared to sign into your services for this TV. No issues with brightness, picture or sound quality. "
"623" "\"TruMotion 120\" is in fact a 60Hz refresh rate. This is missleading and was disappointing to learn; I thought LG would be above something like this. "
"624" "Yeah, cheaply built tv, but I like LGs picture. If you're looking for Samsung's 8 billion nits for HDR or color to pop, not the tv, but fairly priced, legs can't get any worse, but again,for price.. Awesome. Be better if hanged on wall, because not the most aesthetically pleasing, but not bad either. Love thinQ and LG has best as good an OS and UI as anyone. "
"625" "Only last ed 3 years,They don't last cheap tv "
"626" "WOW! The price was Amazing. The quality outstanding.... "
"627" "The price and quality on image is awesome, but the description features are a lie. No Netflix at all, beats the purpose of having a Netflix bottom, doesn't even have Hulu. the image quality is great but that's all. "
"628" "Has a cheaper 8bit RGBW sub pixel layout. In the dark, the blacks look more grey. Also noticed some image retention issues.Don't get me wrong though, this is still a great looking TV for the price. Just not a real 4K TV. If your looking for 4K, look elsewhere. If you're not too picky, this TV should do you well. "
"629" "Lg have a problem with the led going out after 2 to 3 years "
"630" "Went to my mother in law to surprise her on Thanksgiving with a new LG TV put the legs on and plugged it in and was so disappointed when the screen was broken very disappointed 9203590006 "
"631" "I recive it broken "
"632" "Was delivered twice with a crack in the screen. Horrible! "
"633" "Wish it had better blacks, might wanna look elsewhere for that. Otherwise it's a great TV. "
"634" "the input icon is easy to miss, and with a lack of set-up instructions, was the only issue with set-up "
"635" "Beautiful TV and great customer service "
"636" "tv is dark but I ampart blind so whomknow2 stars "
"637" "THE TV SCREEN CAME SMASHED "
"638" "I was surprise "
"639" "This unit is VERY good so far. I really like the visual quality.The only issue I have found with it is that it will not turn on the display when power is applied. You are still required to manually turn on the display using the remote (or the on screen controls I assume). This is a problem if you want to apply power and have it display and go to the right input automatically. "
"640" "I have been impressed at how easy this TV is to program and how clear the picture is along with the quality of the sound. "
"641" "Out of the box the picture is really not very good. I am assuming I have to hire someone to set it up properly. I'm amazed how marginal it look and I reserve final judgment until someone comes in to look at it. Disappointed. "
"642" "I arrived broken ?The worst products I have purchased . "
"643" "The tv arrived with the screen showing just color lines...the screen is definitely bad and I'm returning it. Horrible experience with my first 65 inch tv. I'm going back to Samsung. No more LG tv's for me. The product should be inspected before is shipped. I sadly doubt that the screen was damaged during transportation because it was well packed. "
"644" "Was a nice tv but has blue spots all over the screen now after 2 years. Seems to have lost some colored leds. "
"645" "I did not buy the LG 55UK6300PUE TV. This rant is about LG quality in general. I bought a LG 49LB5550 LED TV a little over three years ago. I began having problems with it almost from day one. The picture would go out, but the sound would still be on. I called LG, who told me to unplug the TV for 60 seconds, then plug it back in and try it. This worked, but the same thing occured repeatedly for at least once a week. It was an annoyance at the time, but simple to remedy. Before the warranty expired, I called the retailer who I purchased it from because the frequency seemed to increase as the TV aged. They deferred to LG, who wasn't interested in doing anything unless it was a hard failure. So as annoying as it was, I lived with it. Then at three years, four months, the annoyance turned into a hard failure. When I plugged it back in, the screen would flash on for maybe a half second, then go black for about five seconds, then repeat. I checked with a couple of repair shops, and their recommendation was to buy a new TV.I did some research and found that LG LED TVs have a high rate of LED failures ( if one LED fails, there is no back light) and other PCB issues. When I was inquiring about which board was most likely causing the failure, one repair technician indicated that he thought LG might be over-driving the LEDs to get the desired brightness.When it was working, the colors and resolution were excellent. But a little over three years of service is horrible. I will never buy another LG product after owning this one. "
"646" "I have to admit, I am not a \"techie\" savvy buyer. People who appreciate specs and numbers may not find my review helpful, HOWEVER, if you are someone who appreciates high quality, high ticket items that perform reliably and consistently...keep reading.I recently converted two bedrooms in my home into one large \"glam room\" fashion/filming studio for vlogging and video editing content for social media. My husband is usually in charge when it comes to electronic purchases and he would be able to rattle off specifications and compare this tv to the other tv's in our home. We have three 75+ inch tv's in other rooms in our home, in addition to a proper screening room/theatre, with some type of high def projector and electronic screen, automatic curtains and whatnot. To be honest, the entire set up is so very complicated that I usually have to have him turn everything on for me. I even find our less complicated LG OLED tv setup in his cigar room with the magic remote a little complicated (and annoying to use). Being that this particular purchase was going to be in a room that he rarely enters, I, quite frankly cared only about the following things:1. Picture quality/brightness2. Integrated sound that was good enough to NOT need a sound bar.3. EASY Internet Connectivity for streaming media4. EASY screen sharing/pairing to my iMac or cameras for video editing5. Reasonably PricedOriginally, I had decided to only get a 50\" TV since it was going to essentially be in a giant walk-in closet/makeup room and I was going to be the only one using it. I didn't want to spend much more than $1000 and I really like the picture quality/ease of connectivity of our LG OLEDs so I started browsing LG brand tv's when I stumbled on this LG 65\" LED tv at $541.00! I know it is not OLED, but for what I need it for it seemed perfect. I quickly jumped on the chance and had it delivered to my front door (damage free!), within two days using Amazon Prime. I also had pre paid for the expert installation through Amazon and they set up my appointment for the day of delivery, and I am SO glad I did.My TV was mounted, hung and installed within one hour of the technician's arrival. He set up the TV to my router and cable box and connected it to my wifi network. This purchase definitely exceeded my expectations. The brightness is spectacular. The sound is very good without a sound bar. I listen to music and watch videos all day and the sound does not get distorted at higher volumes. The TV was easy to set up and download and install all the apps and updates that I need. The remote is very basic, and easy to use and includes a button for both Netflix and Amazon. I can connect to my computer and other peripherals with one button and the price was an absolute steal.I do think that there is a difference between this TV compared to our OLED's when viewing cinematic movies, but not by that much that I would hesitate to recommend it to someone who is looking to purchase a solid high quality TV at an affordable price. I love it so much I actually ended up purchasing an additional identical set for our home office! "
"647" "My husband purchased this television for your living room. When I watch it I feel like I am in the action and on the set of the movie or show. I have never had a tv where the picture was so in depth. You won't be disappointed. "
"648" "Package come in very good packaging no damage, my son is very happy for his bedroom to play games, but for me pictures quality not satisfied me. It's ok just for my son he want a big TV this 43\" is good big enough for his bedroom, easy to install, easy to setup without any problem WiFi connected, but HDMI port is just one only, I need at least 3 of it and can't use connect to desktop computer. Not sure how, I maybe ask to my BFF how it's work in desktop computer "
"649" "I am highly disappointed to finally get home to my early Christmas gift to myself only to remove the television from the box and see a crack in the screen. This is totally unacceptable!! I cant even begin a ticket to start the refund process! For the past hour I have been trying to complete this process however the options are not available. The cost of the television plus time off work waiting for delivery has me VERY aggravated at this point. I should have became suspicious when the delivery guy was quick to get my signature and leave however, I was needing to head back to work. I will NOT be so trusting in the future. I will escalate the problem until a solution has been reached. "
"650" "I can not give an adequate review. I ordered this TV twice had to return both times for major damages internally and externally. It seemed nicely built but unless you pick it up shipping it will prove to be futile as it will never arrive without damage. "
"651" "I love that you can watch Amazon prime with a push off a button.The tv itself is amazing.There is nothing I don't like about it.It arrived unharmed. "
"652" "Tv was not working correctly. Had to call a repair shop to fix the screen. Won¡¯t be repaired for another week. Second tv delivered and neither one worked correctly. Do you have a problem delivering tv¡¯s. I would say you do. "
"653" "Received this TV yesterday. It is amazing. I have been using a hd 1080p tv but the LG set blows it away. It's like being outside and seeing things in their natural color and clarity. I also have an Xbox one x and the games now are amazing. I couldn't be happier. "
"654" "Great buy "
"655" "the picture quality is good enough, the hdr 10 effects are on the weaker end but overall if this is youre first time experiencing 4k i think you'd be happy "
"656" "I love it "
"657" "Good price "
"658" "Totally worth the buy. "
"659" "perfect "
"660" "Love my new TV, Met all expectations "
"661" "Good buy for the price and quality! Also have an older version of the same collection of TVs (43\") "
"662" "I am looking for a tv and after reading reviews and watching YT videos i decided to buy this.I am sure it will fit perfect at my house. "
"663" "The tv is great and amazing! I did not order from amazon but got it in store. Everything worked prefect , it true that the WiFi have it up and down. I don¡¯t really use the smart hubs, since I use apple tv4k for Netflix and such. So it don¡¯t matter for me.The sound on there is actually real nice! I have my own set of speakers, but the sound on it own is nice and clear.Every TV have it good and bad.But don¡¯t blame LG for your TV coming broken or crack. USPS/UPS is to blame. "
"664" "Nice television "
"665" "For the price, this LG model offers great functionality and picture quality. Remote and interactive screens are easy to navigate, and set up was easy. WiFi connection and logons to Netflix and Amazon Prime stay active, and we've not had to re-login since the initial set up. "
"666" "I bought this TV as a birthday gift for myself. I opened the box just to realise a deep dent in the TV. This is really awful and heart breaking "
"667" "Excelente "
"668" "All LG TVs have a hardware flaw that causes them to continually lose streaming internet service.Customer service is a joke. Buy anything else. "
"669" "A very nice TV. SMart works well with Alexa. The setup was less than 5 minutes. I located and set the TV on the stand alone, no help and was not really a problem. Picture is really good and has adjustments to fit your preferences. Sound is good but I added a sound bar purchased from Amazon to enhance the sound spectrum and the range..... Mine is on its feet, not on a wall and is very stable....... "
"670" "I like this tv. "
"671" "went dead after 8 days, returned for refund. "
"672" "Awesome tv! Huge! Easy to set up and navigate through. Great Price "
"673" "So far I recieved my TV today, they did not leave it where I asked but I got it no problems, I thought for sure it would be opened and broken or not work. But so far it was packed well and working . I had some issues staying connected to internet but I connected using Ethernet connect from adapter and that seems to be steady signal. Overall sound quality is amazing It is very loud and i only have it on 10 volume. Havent even tried going above that. It has set up directions so overall was easy set up I have not tried all wireless apps and stuff except hdmi connect of my Amazon firestick which works fine. I'd recommend this to anyone. I'm hoping that i have no issues w the TV. But i was able to register the TV on LG site pretty easily using the info on back TV model and SN. I have had TV for few wks and so far I love it , it didnt stay connected wireless so I just added the extender with ethernet adapter and seems to make it stable for wifi but overall nice TV great deal! I recommend to anyone "
